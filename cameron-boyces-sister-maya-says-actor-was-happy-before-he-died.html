Yes, I’m sad,” she captioned several photos of the two of them together. “Cameron was my best friend. He is someone I will always idolize. His smile could light up a room, unlike anyone else’s. He was perfect. He always said that if you have a voice, you have the privilege of using that voice for change, and he did not take that lightly. He understood his responsibility as someone so many kids would look up to.”</p><p>Maya continued to talk about some of Cameron’s best qualities. “Cameron always went out of his way to be giving and kind,” she wrote. “He did more with his 20 years of life than most people ever could with 100 years. He was actively charitable. He traveled the world. He made creativity and art his life’s mission, and he encouraged others to do the same.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-864927672-1.jpg><p>The brunette beauty confessed to her followers that it’s important to move on, but she will always cherish the time they spent together. “Of course, I am devastated,” she said. “I will be for the rest of my life. But what I’m holding onto, and what I encourage you to hold onto as well, is the memory of his endless optimism. He was sunlight wearing shoes. I can confidently say, he wants us to celebrate, grow and persevere.”</p><p>Maya ended the message on a positive note, though, and shared what her brother’s mindset was like before his untimely death. “Yes, he died. Yes, I’m sad. I’m also happy. And grateful,” she said. “I was with him hours before he died. It was normal and fun. We said, ‘I love you.’ He was happy. I spent 17 years knowing what it was like to be loved by Cameron Boyce. That is the most beautiful gift I have ever received.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-8.03.09-AM.png><p>On Saturday, July 6, the Boyce family released a statement about the 20-year-old <a href=#>Disney</a> Channel star. “It is with a profoundly heavy heart that we report that this morning we lost Cameron,” a spokesperson for the family told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the time. “He passed away in his sleep due to a seizure, which was a result of an ongoing medical condition for which he was being treated. The world is now undoubtedly without ones of its brightest lights, but his spirit will live on through the kindness and compassion of all who knew and loved him. We are utterly heartbroken and ask for privacy during this immensely difficult time as we grieve the loss of our precious son and brother.”</p><p>Following Cameron’s death, his parents, <a href=#><strong>Libby Boyce</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Victor Boyce</strong></a>, had nothing but <a href=#>kind things to say about their son</a>. “There are no words to describe how we moved we are by the tremendous outpouring of love and support from our family, friends and the world,” they shared in a statement to <a href=#>E! News</a> on Wednesday, July 10. “Thank you, everyone, for encircling us with your love and respect of Cameron and concert for our family. He was the definition of human kindness, and a light that will forever shine as his spirit lives on in all who knew and loved him. He was the rock of our family, and he always had a positive, heartwarming, insightful and caring outlook on everything and everyone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cameron-Boyce-Parents.jpg><p>We are thinking of the Boyce family during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJompqllae8r3nBqLCcnaNiwKq%2F056pZqWRrq5uv8CyqmaZk6m8s3nWmqpmoJGlvbp5wZ6dqKqVYrWmecOinJ1n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./charleston-white-net-worth-2023-2024-2025-2026.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charleston White Net Worth 2024">&larr;
