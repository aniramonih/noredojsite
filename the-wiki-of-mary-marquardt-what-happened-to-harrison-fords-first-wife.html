After a few years of dating, the couple married on<strong> June 18, 1964</strong>, in a wedding ceremony.</p><p>Their first son, Benjamin, was born two years later, and their second son, Willard Ford, was born in 1969. Mary played an important part in Harrison’s early career, supporting him and urging him to continue his career.</p><p>Ford’s breakout performance as Han Solo in the film “Star Wars” came in 1977, but his popularity ended their marriage when he began an adulterous romance with his co-star Carrie Fisher. He didn’t dispute the affair, and he and Mary divorced after fifteen years of marriage in 1979.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Atz Lee Kilcher, A Star Of “Alaska: The Last Frontier,” Got Married</a></p><h2><span id=Harrison_Ford_Mary_Marquardt8217s_ex-husband>Harrison Ford, Mary Marquardt’s ex-husband</span></h2><p>Mary rose to fame as a result of her ex-viral husband’s popularity, so let us share some of his life and work with you.</p><p>Harrison Ford was born on <strong>July 13, 1942</strong>, in Chicago, Illinois, USA, to Christopher Ford and Dorothy Ford. Mary Marquardt is of mixed Jewish, Irish, and German descent.</p><p>He attended Maine East High School in Park Ridge, Illinois, and later Ripon College, where he met his first wife. He studied philosophy, but in his senior year, he attended acting classes to overcome his timidity.</p><p>However, Ford became interested in performing and, after graduating from college, Harrison joined the Belfry Players.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_to_Harrison_Ford8217s_first_wife>What happened to Harrison Ford’s first wife?</span></h2><p>Following her divorce from Ford, Mary resumed her career as a chef and worked at her ex-husband Harrison Ford’s Culver City Filling Station.</p><p>Later, it was determined that she had multiple sclerosis, but there has been no word of her death since then. Nonetheless, she has faded into obscurity, maintained by her son, Benjamin Ford, who looks after her.</p><p>Wikimedia Commons has a page dedicated to Mary Marquardt’s age, childhood, and education.</p><p>Mary’s personal information is limited to the fact that she was born in 1945, somewhere in the United States; there is no information on her parents, such as their names or occupations.</p><p>After matriculation, she enrolled in the famous liberal arts Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin, for her studies. Her life altered when she met her first husband, Harrison Ford, in college. Harrison was nothing close to beginning his acting career, let alone being a successful actor, at the time.</p><h2><span id=Beginnings_of_a_Career_and_Ascension_to_Prominence>Beginnings of a Career and Ascension to Prominence</span></h2><p>Harrison battled with lesser roles in films such as “Luv” and “A Time For Killing,” both in 1967, among others, until signing a deal with Universal Studios and appearing in TV programs such as “Gunsmoke,” “The Virginian,” and others.</p><p>However, he was dissatisfied with the tasks he was being offered and chose to shift his focus to being a professional carpenter. He needed any employment to provide for his children and Mary.</p><p>Nonetheless, he had a big break when he auditioned for the role of Bob Falfa in George Lucas’ 1973 film “American Graffiti.</p><p>“He and Lucas became friends, and in 1977, Lucas offered him the lead part in “Star Wars.” Since then, Harrison has played Han Solo in every film in the saga, including “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980), “Return of the Jedi” (1983), and most recently “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”</p><p>His portrayal as Han Solo catapulted him to stardom, and he has since gone on to have a successful career as Indiana Jones in the “Indiana Jones” franchise, Rick Deckard in the “Blade Runner” film, and countless other roles.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Mary_Marquardt_start_her_Professional_Career>How did Mary Marquardt start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Following her education, Mary began her career as a chef, and as she and her husband’s careers progressed, they purchased restaurants across the United States, where she worked as a chef.</p><p>When they split, she remained in the post, with the assistance of her son Benjamin Ford.
