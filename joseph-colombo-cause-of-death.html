Despite the fact that he survived the attack on June 28, 1971, Colombo’s wounds rendered him virtually entirely paraplegic, and he died as a result.</strong></p><p>He died seven years later from heart failure as a result of his injuries’ long-term repercussions.</p><h2>“How can they make a guy like Colombo sit at the Commission?”</h2><p>That question — posed by Frank Majuri, then underboss of New Jersey’s DeCavalacante crime family to his boss, Simone DeCavalacante — was captured on tape by the FBI and released publicly in 1969.</p><p>Joe Colombo didn’t fit the mold of a typical Mafia boss, at least in the minds of those who opposed him. Though he was a rising capo in the Profaci crime family, Colombo’s criminal record up to that point contained only two little infractions, a dollar fine for each.</p><p><a href=#><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/themobmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1971_Joseph_Colombo_Shot-1-1024x875.jpg decoding=async alt="Joseph Colombo Cause of Death" width=1024 height=875 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>His role in the hierarchy of the Magliocco crime family, however, took a dramatic leap when he defied orders from his boss, Joe Magliocco, to carry out a brazen plot against the heads of two other New York families. Tasked with killing Gaetano “Tommy” Lucchese and Carlo Gambino, Colombo instead went to the intended targets and tipped them off to the conspiracy.</p><p>The story goes that Magliocco, who stepped in as boss when Joe Profaci died in 1962, already had problems with a renegade faction of the former Profaci family – the Gallo brothers: Albert “Kid Blast” Gallo, Larry Gallo and Joseph “Crazy Joe” Gallo. Both Magliocco and Colombo were kidnapped and held for ransom at one point by the Gallos.</p><h2 id=joe-colombos-wife-and-children-hidden-inside-mafia-secrets>Joe Colombo’s Wife And Children Hidden Inside Mafia Secrets</h2><p>In 1944, Joseph Colombo married Lucille Faiello, with whom he had five children. The details between Joe and Lucille have always been a mystery and have not been revealed in public.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-trendingpal_com-banner-1-0></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-trendingpal_com-banner-1-0_1></span>Among the five children, their four sons were Christopher Colombo, Joseph Colombo Jr., Anthony Colombo, and Vincent Colombo. While their only daughter is Catherine Colombo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/themobmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1971_Joseph_Colombo_Shot-1-1024x875.jpg><p>His sons have never been enrolled in any crime bearing their father’s name. However, they have always been in the picture due to their father’s deed.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-trendingpal_com-box-4-0></span>Earlier, his son Joseph was arrested on federal charges in 1970, and the following year, he was acquitted. Likewise, Joseph and his brothers were further indicted on racketeering accusations of bookmaking and bribery a few years later, in 1985.</p><p>Anthony was sentenced to 14 years in prison for this attempt, and his brothers were given a five-year sentence.</p><h2 id=lucille-faiello-age-wikipedia-and-kids-family>Lucille Faiello Age Wikipedia And Kids Family</h2><p>Born in 1920, Lucille Faiello was 76 years old when she died.</p><p>The Colombos previously lived in a tiny house in Brooklyn’s Dyker Heights and later were reported to live on a five-acre estate in Blooming Grove, New York.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-trendingpal_com-leader-1-0></span><span id=div-gpt-ad-trendingpal_com-leader-1-0_1></span>In the early 1960s, Joseph “Jon” had become one of the Profaci family’s most powerful men. In detail, the Profaci crime family was one of New York City’s “Five Families” of the American mafia.</p><p>Joseph Profaci, who was the family’s patriarch, considered Jon to be one of his most trustworthy men. As an enforcer, Jon’s primary responsibilities included extortion and other physical labor for his organization.</p><p>Jon Colombo was critically wounded by a lone gunman shooting several bullets at him at the second Civil Rights League rally in 1971. After this incident, Colombo had been unresponsive, remaining in a coma for seven years. He passed away on May 22, 1978, due to a heart attack.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOo6asnaCdeqS7y6ikm6ddmK62v8Rmpp9llJqutbSO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./justin-ross-martin-net-worth-income-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Justin Ross Martin Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
