The bar added that although it supports free debate and the exchange of ideas, it does not allow “hate speech” in the establishment.</p><p>In a Facebook post on April 11, 2023, which has now been deleted or removed, the bar released a statement that read, “We are tired of all of the hate. We are very open to debate and discussion and it's truly a shame that we can't have open conversations about this important political and cultural topic. Bars, in our opinion, exist as public spaces where ideas should be exchanged. Unfortunately, due to all of the bigotry and hatred that has surfaced around the Bud Light controversy, any patron wanting to voice their concerns about the issue will be immediately asked to pay their bill and leave our establishment," states <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DailyMail.</a></p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Bud Light pours at bars and restaurants take steep nosedive across the country: Data</a></p><p><a href=# rel>‘Go woke, go broke’: Bud Light slammed for partnering with controversial trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney</a></p><p>Several social media users took to the comments section of the post, with one writing, as per DailyMail, "Thank you for taking a stand. I applaud your decision to be inclusive while still exercising your right as a business owner to deny service/patronage to people who think the house rules don't apply to them." While others were quick to say, "Get woke, go broke."</p><h2 class=split>What is the Bud Light controversy?</h2><p>On April 1, Dylan Mulvaney, a 26-year-old transgender influencer, received a few beer cans from Bud Light as part of a paid sponsorship. Mulvaney shared a video of herself dressed as Holly Golightly from 'Breakfast at Tiffany’s' with the beer cans with a caption that read, “Happy March Madness!! Just found out this had to do with sports and not just saying it’s a crazy month! In celebration of this sports thing @budlight is giving you the chance to win $15,000!” However, the promotion sparked outrage among some people because of Mulvaney’s transgender identity, leading to a boycott of the brand.</p><p>Right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro reacted to the collaboration on his show and said, “Well, folks, our culture has now decided men are women and women are men and you must be forced to consume products that say so.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who is the owner of The Fairfax Bar and Grill?</h2><p>The owner of the Indiana-based bar is McKinley Minniefield, who has owned the bar for almost two years. He wrote on the bar's official Facebook page, "A lot has been said - some correct, and some incorrect - and I want to clarify my stance. What I really want to convey is this: just be respectful. Different opinions are welcome here as long as they are delivered respectfully."</p><p>"We’d no more want ugly, aggressive or rude interactions about which sports team someone thinks is better, than about societal issues. We do not and will not censor opinions, but we do require civility in this establishment. So if you can’t play nice, then get out of the sandbox. That goes for everyone! Let’s remember why we even gather at a bar - to enjoy each other’s company - and raise a glass to civility," he added in the post.</p><p>Talking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Newsweek</a>, Minniefield said, "I won't tolerate hate speech, and I think that's where I draw the line as a human, as a business owner. I'm 100 percent open to debate and to offering a place where people can and exchange ideas. I think it's really important that we keep these public places—bars, these places where people can come and have a beer and sit next to somebody, share a beer with somebody they maybe don't agree with or see eye to eye with."</p><p>He further added, "I've definitely lost customers, there's no doubt about it. There are quite a few regulars who I know by name, almost daily customers, who haven't been in since this controversy has dawned on my doors."</p><p>Minniefield continued, "But I feel like every person we lost, we've so far gained a couple new people filling those seats every day. Time will tell whether or not they'll stick around and become regulars, too. We've seen an increase of people who are open-minded and show support because we took a stand."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikerDDzaxkraCVYrOitdGfmLFlkpa%2Fbq3NnWSgqpmhuW61zZ2gmqaRYq%2BivoysrKmon6fBtHnBrptmpJmctbV5wKagnWWUrrmiuoymrKWukaOyunnCqKWtqp%2BrsrO%2F2A%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brett-hadley-cause-of-death-wikipedia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Was Brett Hadley?
