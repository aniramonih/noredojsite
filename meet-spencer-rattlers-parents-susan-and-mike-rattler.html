The University of South Carolina Gamecocks’ quarterback, Spencer Rattler (born September 28, 2000), does not need much of an introduction himself.</p><p>His mother Susan is a 2nd-grade teacher while his father Mike is a former football coach who currently works as a regional sales rep under the employ of Citizens Automobile and Recreation Finance. Spencer Rattler’s parents have played a significant role in his seismic rise to become one of the biggest NFL prospects in the country.</p><h2><strong>Spencer Rattler’s Dad Played High School Football</strong></h2><p>Spencer Rattler is the primary reason anyone recognizes the name Mike Rattler. For most of his life, the African American father of the talented quarterback has lived in the shadows of his son’s fame which has come about as a result of the immense football skills the young Spencer has displayed regularly over time.</p><p>Born Michael Rattler in Phoenix, Arizona, Spencer Rattler’s father has yet to reveal much about his early life and family background. For one, no one up to this point has been able to accurately decipher his exact date of birth. Given that he appears to be a few years older than Spencer’s mother, who was born in the early 1970s, it would not be too far off to assume that he was born in the late 1960s.</p><p>The identity of his parents or any other family member is also shrouded in mystery, but given his skin color, one could say that they are 100 per cent African American. Also, very little is known about his formal educational background, but there have been a lot of sources who claim that Mike Rattler played football in high school as well.</p><p>One would find it quite challenging to argue against the truth of those reports given the immense talents that have been displayed by his son Spencer. Unlike his son, Mike Spencer did not play the sport beyond the high school level, and despite a brief involvement as a football coach, he has chosen and settled down with a different profession as a means to earn an income and provide for his family.</p><h3><strong>Mike Rattler Currently Works As A Sales Rep</strong></h3><p>In a bid to stay in touch with what was essentially his first love, Mike Rattler earned coaching badges by working with different youth groups and clubs in different leagues. His first-hand knowledge of the game proved invaluable for a lot of the young people he was able to impact with that knowledge.</p><p>A glimpse into how well Spencer Rattler has done as a football player will paint a good picture of how well Mike Rattler has done as a football coach. These days, however, the celebrity dad earns his living in a different profession as a Citizens Automobile and Recreation Finance sales rep.</p><h2><strong>Spencer Rattler’s Mother is a Teacher</strong></h2><p>Known officially as Susan Konkel Rattler, Spencer Rattler’s mother was born on March 17, 1970, under the sun sign of Pisces, Phoenix, Arizona. Beyond those basic particulars, Susan Rattler was also a relatively unknown entity until her son shot into the limelight. Not much is known about her birth family, including her parents and any other family member like a sibling.</p><p>Despite his albinism, Spencer Rattler’s ethnicity is mixed, with 50 percent of his ethnic identity coming from his mom’s 100 percent Caucasian ethnic identity. Another aspect of Susan Rattler’s life that adequately fits under the unknown pile is her formal educational background. We have no way of telling where she received her high school diploma or if she acquired a college degree.</p><p>Susan Rattler is a grade school teacher. She currently specializes in teaching grade 2 students. There are also quite a number of outlets that claim that in addition to her responsibilities as a teacher, Spencer Rattler’s mother is also an author. However, that intel has not been verified, partly because she has no known published works at the moment.</p><h2><strong>Spencer Rattler’s Parents Have Been Married For Over 2 Decades</strong></h2><p>Mike and Susan Rattler has been married for more than 20 years. By that admission, one might say that they have been a couple for longer than that. The finer details of their relationship, including how, when, or where they met, have been overshadowed by the achievements of their children.</p><p>Nothing about his early life history suggests that Spencer Rattler’s parents had him out of wedlock. Given that they had him on September 28, 2000, it is most likely that their wedding ceremony took place in the late 1990s. As previously stated, that is an aspect of their early years as a couple that we have yet to figure out.</p><p>They have remained together through thick and thin, and they have raised a wonderful and relatively successful son in Spencer Rattler. The satisfaction they get in seeing him succeed is one thing that every parent aspires to.</p><h2><strong>Spencer Rattler is Not The Only Child of His Parents</strong></h2><p>Just a couple of years after having the talented quarterback, Mike and Susan Rattler were blessed with yet another miracle of a child. This time around, they had a beautiful daughter named Olivia Rattler. Spencer Rattler’s beautiful little sister was born on December 17, 2002.</p><p>Up until she had to move away for college, the trajectory of Olivia Rattler’s formal educational background moved in a similar pattern to her older brother’s. They are both alums of Pinnacle High School, Arizona. Just like her brother, Olivia is also an active athlete. The only difference is that they play different sports.</p><p>Similar to her football star brother, Olivia Rattler has carved out a niche for herself in the world of volleyball. She played the sport all through the four years of high school, and as a freshman at Missouri State University, the 21-year-old has already caught the eye with some of her displays on the volleyball court with the university’s volleyball team.</p><h2><strong>Mike and Susan Have Always Had Spencer’s Back With His Football Career</strong></h2><p>Besides his enthralling football skills, the immense backing and support he has received from his parents for his football career is another thing that Spencer Rattler has come to rely on. To say that those have been invaluable would be putting it mildly. His father has never missed any of his games, and we all know he has been actively involved in plenty.</p><p>Mike Rattler has also assumed the responsibility of handling his NFL interviews to minimize the distraction to his game. On the other hand, Susan Rattler has been quite vocal with her support via various social media platforms.</p><p>All the hard work and support his parents put in to ensure his success as a football player is not lost on Spencer, and he takes every little opportunity to remind them and the world that he sees and appreciates all of it.</p><p>The 23-year-old Arizona native may be the biggest star in his family at the moment, but his parents have done an incredible job behind the scenes to make sure of it. More celebrity parents could learn a thing or two from them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmqqmdnpiys3nRmqutpJWnwG68wKucp6yjYsC2v8CnZJqmlGK6qrfEZqmarKShsrN7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./memphis-depay.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Memphis Depay - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Body Measurement, Career">&larr;
