Here, we are discussing bodybuilder Sally, who murdered her husband Ray McNeil following a domestic altercation.</p><p>Due to the November 2, 2022 debut of the “Killer Sally” series on Netflix, the murder case of Mr. California’s title winner became a popular issue in 2022.

They became well-known, and Mr. California even had a significant role in an advertisement starring&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Jason Alexander</a>&nbsp;and Lloyd Bridges.</p><p>Careerwise Sally was also doing well; she appeared in several wrestling DVDs and made a respectable sum of money. Friends of the couple claim that living with two-star bodybuilders wasn’t always simple because dieting and losing weight are difficult during these times. As the tension grew, it used to be let out in arguments on both sides.</p><p>Sally had requested a temporary restraining order against her husband in 1990, according to the records. She alleges that he hit and threw her.

Ray arrived home that evening late, according to the police. He was asked by Sally where he was. When they started to argue, Ray allegedly hit the woman and grabbed her by the throat.</p><p><strong>According to authorities,</strong>&nbsp;a female bodybuilder then seized a loaded shotgun and shot the victim twice, once in the chest and once in the jaw, killing him.</p><p>In her testimonies, McNeils claimed that it was a case of self-defense; yet, the court sentenced her to 19 years in prison.</p><h2><span id=How_Sally_McNeil_Met_Ray_McNeil>How Sally McNeil Met Ray McNeil?</span></h2><p>While serving as Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton in the San Diego area, Sally and Ray McNeil met and fell in love.&nbsp;<strong>They got married after only three months</strong>, without any delay. We want to be clear that the woman had two children—a son called John and a daughter named Shantina—from her prior marriage to Anthony Lowden.</p><p>Sally’s best friend, Jennifer Brooks, revealed that the female bodybuilder was madly in love with Ray and would go over and tell him every time she performed something she felt was worth something to her. Jennifer compared it to witnessing a 16-year-old fall in love.</p><p>How Much Is&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Ava Louise’s Net Worth</a></strong>?
