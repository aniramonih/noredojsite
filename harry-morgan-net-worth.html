As Alan [Alda] said, he did not have an unadorable bone in his body. He was a treasure as a person, an imp at times, and always a true professional. He had worked with the greats and never saw himself as one of them. But he was. He was the rock everyone depended on and yet he could cut up like a kid when the situation warranted it. He was the apotheosis, the finest example of what people call a 'character actor.' What he brought to the work made everyone better. He made those who are thought of as 'stars' shine even more brightly. The love and admiration we all felt for him were returned tenfold in many, many ways."</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>Morgan earned 11 Primetime Emmy nominations, nine as an actor on "M*A*S*H," one as a director on "M*A*S*H," and one for "December Bride."
