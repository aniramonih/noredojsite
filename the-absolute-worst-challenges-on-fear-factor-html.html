But sometimes, the challenges on the show were so outrageous that you might wonder if anyone would actually attempt them. Let’s take a look at some of the most stomach-turning challenges from the show.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Drinking Blended Rat in New York</strong></h3><p>In one episode, contestants were given a truly New York-themed challenge. Instead of the usual tall buildings or city landmarks, they had to drink a blended rat! Yes, you read that right. The rats were already dead, but it was still a raw rat in a blender. Surprisingly, the participants drank it without much fuss. Well, except for the one who lost her lunch right after.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Shoveling Roadkill</strong></h3><p>In another episode, contestants had to shovel roadkill onto a target on the ground. Depending on their accuracy, they had to eat a portion of the critter they just tossed. The contestants’ reactions were pretty understandable, as the shapeless, colorless goop they received was cold and unappetizing. This challenge raised questions about the safety of eating roadkill, considering the maggots and flies crawling on it.</p><h3><strong>Cow Eye Juice</strong></h3><p>In a segment titled “Cow Eye Juice,” contestants were required to pick up cow eyes with their teeth, pop them into a glass, and drink it once the glass was full. Cow eye fluid, unlike human eye fluid, was black, and contestants described it as “salty, like dirt water.” The entire challenge was repulsive on every level, and it’s unclear if the fluid’s color was normal or due to decay.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Dunking in 50 Gallons of Cow’s Blood</strong></h3><p>Imagine a tub filled with 50 gallons of cow’s blood, and you have to dunk your head in it to retrieve rings. In this challenge, contestants couldn’t see anything through the blood, making it even more horrifying. One contestant got so frustrated that he started screaming and slamming his fist into the blood, achieving nothing in the end.</p><h3><strong>Milking a Goat… With Your Mouth</strong></h3><p>In “Semi Finals: Part 1,” contestants had to milk a goat but with a twist. They couldn’t use their hands; they had to suck the milk straight from the goat like a baby goat, spit it into a glass, and drink it once the glass was full. It was a combination of weird factors that made this challenge utterly disgusting.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Chewing on Intestines</strong></h3><p>In one segment titled “Intestine Chew, Milk, and Chug,” contestants were covered in cow intestines. They had to bite into the intestines with their teeth, squeeze the intestinal fluid into a glass (thankfully, they could use their hands for this part), and then chug it down. The intestines were rubbery, hard to chew through, and the resulting mess looked like curdled eggnog.</p><h3><strong>Horse Rectum Challenge</strong></h3><p>Horses are usually considered off-limits for consumption, but in one episode, contestants played a game of horseshoes to determine how many inches of raw horse rectum they had to eat. It was a taboo-breaking challenge, and the reactions of the participants were a mix of disgust and disappointment, especially when one couldn’t finish and was told, “You ate 12 inches for nothing.”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Worm Wine</strong></h3><p>The “Worm Wine” challenge involved contestants stomping nightcrawlers to produce a thick, brackish liquid that they had to drink from wine glasses. Topping it off, they had to eat whole, non-blended, still-living stink bugs, flies, or tomato hornworms. The resulting concoction was vile, and the “two-for-one day” rule made it even worse.</p><h3><strong>Sheep Eyeballs</strong></h3><p>In an early episode of the show, contestants had to eat three sheep eyeballs within three minutes. The eyes reportedly smelled and tasted terrible. What made this challenge even more bizarre was the presence of sheep in the barn-like set, seemingly watching the contestants commit a crime against sheepdom.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Lech Challenge</strong></h3><p>Contestants in one episode had to lay in a bathtub filled with leeches for 30 seconds. Then, their partners had to suck 30 leeches off their bodies and spit them into a glass container. Both team members had to eat 10 of the leeches apiece. Things took a disturbing turn when one contestant complained of something stuck in his throat, only to cough up a living leech along with a glob of blood.</p><h3><strong>Tall Crappaccino</strong></h3><p>If you’re a coffee lover, you may not want to hear about the “Tall Crappaccino.” Instead of aromatic coffee beans, this drink featured a blend of stink bugs, flies, and tomato hornworms. Contestants also received a random topping of whole, living insects on the drink. Drinking the “Tall Crappaccino” wasn’t for the faint of heart.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>House of Flies</strong></h3><p>In an episode hosted by Ludacris, contestants had their heads enclosed in plexiglass boxes filled with 300,000 flies. Their task was to grab marshmallows hanging by strings with their mouths while enduring the constant presence of flies buzzing around. The flies managed to find their way into contestants’ facial orifices, including their mouths, making this challenge especially cringe-worthy.</p><p>In the end, Fear Factor was all about pushing contestants to their limits, and it succeeded with these hair-raising and stomach-churning challenges. It’s safe to say that these are some of the worst challenges in the history of the show.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxyfo6tn55lkZfAsLjUrZxmr5%2BnwLV5wqGYpaSVo7Smv4yopWaelZa%2FbrLAnKuoql6dwa64</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-shady-side-of-dwayne-johnson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Shady Side Of Dwayne Johnson">&larr;
