It is a hoax that claims that the former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson has died at the age of 57. The hoax has been spread by various fake news websites, such as Mediamass, The Viral Pink, and Boxing99s, that have published articles with sensational headlines and false information about Tyson’s alleged demise. Some of these articles have used the phrase “Mike Tyson is dead 43” as part of their titles, which has led to confusion and curiosity among many internet users.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is Mike Tyson is Dead 43 a Hoax?</h2><p>The rumors about Mike Tyson’s death are unfounded and false. Not only is Tyson alive, but he is also reportedly in good health, leading a peaceful life post his boxing career. He is currently involved in various activities, such as acting, podcasting, and promoting psychedelic drugs. He has also made several public appearances in recent months, such as attending a Miami conference on psychedelics, medicines, and microdosing in November 2023, and filming the movie “Liger” with Indian actor Ananya Panday in the same month. He has also posted several photos and videos on his official Instagram account, showing his daily life and interactions with his family and friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Mike Tyson is Dead 43 Start?</h2><p>The origin of the hoax is unclear, but it may have been influenced by Tyson’s own words that were misunderstood by some readers. In November 2023, he spoke to the New York Post while at the Miami conference, and described his first experience while tripping from toad venom, a psychedelic drug that he reportedly learned about four years ago. He said, “I ‘died’ during my first trip. In my trips I’ve seen that death is beautiful. Life and death both have to be beautiful, but death has a bad rep. The toad has taught me that I’m not going to be here forever. There’s an expiration date.” He was referring to the spiritual and psychological effects of the drug, not his actual physical death. However, some people may have taken his words literally, and started spreading the rumor that he had died.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to Avoid Falling for Mike Tyson is Dead 43?</h2><p>The best way to avoid falling for the hoax is to check the credibility and reliability of the sources that are reporting the news. Many of the websites that have published the hoax are known for creating and spreading fake news, and they often use clickbait headlines and sensationalized content to attract attention and generate revenue. They also lack proper citations and references, and often contradict themselves or other reputable sources. Therefore, it is advisable to verify the information from multiple and trustworthy sources, such as Snopes, which is a fact-checking website that has debunked the hoax, or Tyson’s own social media accounts, which show that he is alive and well. Additionally, it is important to be critical and skeptical of any news that sounds too good or too bad to be true, and to always do some research before believing or sharing anything online.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JforassYytsKynnmK2tHnDnpidZWRoerW0xGarq62knXqjsceipZ1lpJ2ybsLIq5ilZZikrrl7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nathaniel-logan-mcintyre-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nathaniel Logan McIntyre Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
