He has been on a hunger strike since September 14, 2023, demanding that the central government restore the quota that was struck down by the Supreme Court in May 2023.</p><p>His protest has sparked violence and clashes between the police and his supporters in Jalna district, where he is based. He has also threatened to immolate himself if his demands are not met by October 31, 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Manoj_Jaranges_History></span><strong>What is Manoj Jarange’s History?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Manoj was born in Mathori village in Gevrai taluka of Beed district in Maharashtra. He belongs to the Maratha Kunbi caste, which is considered a sub-caste of the Maratha community. He completed his secondary education in Beed and then moved to Ambad town in Jalna district to work in a hotel. He married a woman from the same caste and had four children. As per the sources, he is 40 years old (as of 2023).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Political_Career></span><strong>Political Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He joined the Congress party as a worker and was influenced by the ideology of Shivaji Maharaj, the 17th-century Maratha king who fought against the Mughal empire. He later left the party and formed his own organization called Shivba Sanghatana, named after Shivaji, to fight for the rights of the Maratha community. He has been involved in various social and political issues, such as farmers’ suicides, water scarcity, corruption, and unemployment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=As_an_Activist></span><strong>As an Activist</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He became active in the Maratha reservation movement in 2014 when a 15-year-old Maratha girl was gang-raped and murdered by three Dalit men in Kopardi village in Ahmednagar district. The incident triggered widespread outrage and protests across Maharashtra, demanding justice for the victim and reservation for the Maratha community. <a href=#>Manoj Jarange Patil</a> participated in several silent marches and rallies organized by various Maratha groups. He also attacked the accused when they were taken to court for a hearing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Manoj-Jarange-biodata.jpg><p>He intensified his agitation after the Supreme Court quashed the Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, which granted 16% reservation to the Maratha community in government jobs and education. The court ruled that the act violated the 50% ceiling on reservation imposed by the Constitution and that the Maratha community was not socially and educationally backward to warrant such a quota. The court also said that states have no power to identify backward classes and that only the President can do so on the advice of the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC).</p><p>Manoj Jarange demanded that the central government should issue an ordinance or amend the Constitution to restore the reservation for the Maratha community. He also demanded that the NCBC should include the Maratha community in its list of backward classes. He started his hunger strike on September 14, 2023, at Atarvali-Sarate village in Jalna district. He said that he would not end his fast until his demands were met or he died.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Marriage_Wife_Kids></span><strong>Marriage, Wife & Kids</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to the web search results, Manoj Jarange Patil’s wife is from the same caste as him, the Maratha Kunbi. They have four children, two sons and two daughters. The names and ages of their children are not mentioned in the sources.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is reported that they live with Jarange’s parents and three brothers in Ankush Nagar village of Ambad taluka in Jalna district. Jarange’s wife and children have been supporting his hunger strike and his demand for reservations for the Maratha community.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Manoj-Jarange-wiki.jpg><p>They have also faced harassment and threats from some anti-reservation groups and police officials.&nbsp;Manoj Jarange’s wife has appealed to the government and the public to listen to her husband’s voice and fulfill his demands before it is too late.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Parents_Siblings></span><strong>Family, Parents & Siblings </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to the web search results, Jarange’s parents are from Mathori village in Gevrai taluka of Beed district in Maharashtra. They belong to the Maratha Kunbi caste, which is considered a sub-caste of the Maratha community. They are farmers by occupation and own a small piece of land in their village. They have four sons, including Manoj, who is the eldest. The names and ages of his brothers are not mentioned in the sources.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Manoj-Jarange-controversy.jpg><p>However, it is reported that they live with Manoj Jarange’s wife and children in Ankush Nagar village of Ambad taluka in Jalna district.

However, based on some clues from the sources, we can make some assumptions and estimates.</p><p>Manoj belongs to the Maratha Kunbi caste, which is considered as a sub-caste of the Maratha community.&nbsp;The Maratha community constitutes about 30% of Maharashtra’s population and wields significant political and economic clout.&nbsp;However, the Maratha Kunbi caste is mainly engaged in agriculture and faces issues such as land fragmentation, water scarcity, debt, and low productivity</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Manoj-Jarange-biography.jpg><p>Based on these facts, we can estimate that Jarange’s net worth is not very high. He may have some savings from his hotel job and some income from his organization. He may also have some agricultural land and property in his name or his family’s name.</p><p>However, he may also have some debts and expenses for his movement and his family’s education and health. Therefore, his net worth may be somewhere between INR 10 lakh to INR 50 lakh. This is just a rough estimate and may not reflect his actual financial situation.</p><p><strong>Read More Interesting Articles @<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">newsunzip.com</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_the_impact_of_his_protest></span><strong>What is the impact of his protest?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Manoj Jarange Patil’s protest has attracted widespread attention and support from various sections of the Maratha community and other political parties.
