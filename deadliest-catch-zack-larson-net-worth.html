The show focuses on real-life fishing expeditions by a various crew aboard their fishing vessels on the Bering Sea in Alaska.</p><p>One of the quirky and fan favorite stars of the show is Captain <a href=#>Bill Wichrowski</a> also known as Wild Bill. Fans of the star were happy to learn that he had a son, Zack Larson that would also be joining him on his fishing trips.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about Zack Larson including his Net worth.</p><h2><span id=Who-is-Zack-Larson><strong>Who is Zack Larson?</strong></span></h2><p>Larson first stepped into the spotlight on the 8th Season of the show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Deadliest Catch </a>when he was first introduced into by his dad. Unlike his dad who was first offered the opportunity to star on the show during his first few seasons and turned it down, Zack dived right in.</p><p>He seized the opportunity just as it was offered and together with his dad, he has come to produce some of the juiciest drama the show has ever seen.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1295 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/realitystarfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deadliest-Catch-Zack-Larson-career-wiki-bio.jpg alt="Deadliest Catch Zack Larson career wiki bio" width=600 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Taking his mother’s last name, the Bering Sea fisherman made his debut on the show under the fishing vessel F/V Kodiak in 2010 at age 25. He later moved on to work on the F/V Kodiak for over two and a half years since 2012.</p><p>Life on the sea was rough at first with several times wishing he had never joined the crew at all. Challenges occur every time with his engineering skills put to the test. However, he soon came to meet one of his friends Nick McGlashan who has been his deckhand.</p><p>Since then, he has come to love the seas and cannot imagine life away from the sea.</p><h2><span id=Zack-Larson-Net-worth-2023><strong>Zack Larson Net worth 2023</strong></span></h2><p>Larson has seen his life change for the good ever since he embarked on the journey. Deadliest Catch cast Zack Larson net worth is currently estimated to be close to $3 million.</p><p>His salary has not been open to the public and has been under his total discretion.

Offseason Wild Bill’s son got hitched to Dulce Zuloaga over on April 28th, 2017. The wedding was beautiful as seen through the pictures on social media.</p><p>There was some slight tension on the wedding day owing to the differences he had with his dad. However, they sort of worked it out and he attended the private ceremony.</p><p>The newlyweds have been private about their marriage life and wife with no information leaked out even to their craziest of fans. He juggles his time in between the job and family always traveling from Seattle, Washington and Mexico embarking on professional sports as a hobby</p><h3><span id=Wiki-bio><strong>Wiki-bio</strong></span></h3><table width=636><tbody><tr><td width=318><strong>Name</strong></td><td width=318>Zack Larson</td></tr><tr><td width=318><strong>Age</strong></td><td width=318>Undisclosed</td></tr><tr><td width=318><strong>Profession</strong></td><td width=318>Fisherman, TV personality</td></tr><tr><td width=318><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td width=318>Dulce Zuloaga</td></tr><tr><td width=318><strong>Kids</strong></td><td width=318>None</td></tr><tr><td width=318><strong>Birthdate</strong></td><td width=318>August 17</td></tr><tr><td width=318><strong>Birthplace</strong></td><td width=318>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td width=318><strong>Net worth</strong></td><td width=318>$3 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Zack Larson date and place of birth is unknown.
