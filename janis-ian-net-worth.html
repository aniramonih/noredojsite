She has won two Grammy Awards during her career.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Janis Ian is? According to sources, it has been estimated that Ian’s net worth is over $1 million, as of July 2017, accumulated through a lucrative and lengthy music career, which started in the mid ‘60s. Since she is still active in the entertainment industry, her net worth continues to grow.</p><h3>Janis Ian Net Worth $1 Million</h3><p>Although born in New York City, Ian was raised in New Jersey where she attended East Orange High School as well as New York City High School of Music & Art. Her father was a music teacher and possibly influenced Janis’s interest in music. During her childhood her idols were folk pioneers <a href=#>Joan Baez</a> and Odetta, and since she was obviously interested in music and instruments, she started piano lessons when she was just two years old and by the time she was a teenager, Janis was playing several other instruments including harmonica and guitar. When she was twelve, Ian wrote her first song called “Hair of Spun Gold”, which was later recorded for her debut album and published in the folk publication “Broadside”, which no doubt kicked-off her net worth.</p><p>She legally changed her name in 1964 to Janis Ian, making her brother’s middle name her new surname. Her first hit single “Society’s Child (Baby I’ve Been Thinking)” she wrote when she was just 14, which spoke of a forbidden interracial romance, and became a national hit after Leonard Bernstein featured it in “Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution” CBS TV special, however, it was banned or withdrawn by some radio stations as its topic was considered taboo. Nevertheless, it reached no.14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001.</p><p>This enormous success paved Janis’s way to future accomplishments and in 1975 she released her most successful US single “At Seventeen”. Once again she hit the Billboard Hot 100, positioning at no.3 and taking first place on the Adult Contemporary chart, and winning a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance – Female in 1976. Her album “Between the Lines” also had astonishing success, reaching no.1 on Billboard’s album chart.</p><p>Ian then cooperated with producer Giorgio Moroder in 1979 in contributing to <a href=#>Jodie Foster’s</a> film “Foxes” soundtrack. For this purpose, Janis recorded “Fly Too High”, which was also featured on her album “Night Rains”, becoming her first international hit and reaching gold or platinum status in several countries worldwide. After several minor successes during the ‘80s, Ian started Rude Girl Records Inc. in January 1992, which has to the present grown and still oversees the production of her new work. The following year, with the release of her “Breaking Silence” album, she came out as a lesbian and shook-up the public as the album tackled topics such as domestic violence, eroticism and The Holocaust, but certainly drew attention to her..</p><p>After a long break, Janis released “Folk Is the New Black” in 2006. Ian is also known for her open criticism of the RIAA, as she claims they act against the interests of musicians and consumers.</p><p>When it comes to her private life, Janis was married to filmmaker Tino Sargo for five years, before they divorced in 1983. She described their relationship and Sargo’s emotional and physical abuse in her autobiography which was released in 2008. However, in 1989 she met Patricia Snyder who she married in August 2003.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=17.673526140156><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Janis Ian</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 7, 1951</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Soundtrack, Composer, Music Department</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>East Orange Campus High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Patricia Snyder (m. 2003), Tino Sargo (m. 1978–1983)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Victor Eddy Fink, Pearl Eddy Fink</td></tr><tr readability=0.35555555555556><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/janisianpage</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/therealjanisian</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0406283/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.26229508196721><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/janis-ian-mn0000213212</a></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album, Grammy Hall of Fame, Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, At Seventeen, Society's Child, Fly Too High</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Album of the Year, Grammy Award for Song of the Year, Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Locus Award for Best Anthology, At Seventeen, Society's Child, Fly Too High</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Movies</td><td>Janis Ian: Live at Club Cafe</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=1.3846153846154><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2.76><td>1</td><td>(after guesting on a <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> pay-per-view New Year's Eve event) "It was the most disgusting thing I ever saw... and I hope they invite me back."</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=19.124559341951><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>1</td><td>Her 1965 song "Society's Child", about a black man dating a white woman, was turned down by 22 record labels because of its subject matter before Verve/Folkways took a chance on it.
