Toman, who had been sleeping, suggested that the car's automatic 'lane departure assist' had taken over the steering. They managed to turn off the feature after about 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There was also a potential run-in with police in Colorado, near the border to Utah, after someone reported a speeding vehicle. It turned out that Tabbutt and Toman had already passed by&nbsp;the state trooper involved in the police scanner discussion, though.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Apparently the biggest issue they faced during the trip was when one of their strategically-placed assistants forgot to fill the car's main gas tank at a fueling stop, only doing the auxiliary tank.
