professional career with the Miami Dolphins and proved himself on the team before joining other teams in the league.&nbsp;He has displayed a host of exceptional skills over the years and has contributed immeasurably to the victories his teams have recorded in most of his games.&nbsp;Let’s meet this legendary soccer player who was diagnosed with dyslexia and dysphoria but paved his way to stardom.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ted-ginn-jrs-bio></span><strong><span>Ted Ginn Jr’s Bio</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Everyone tends to find immense joy when they are able to overcome life’s temptations, and Ted Ginn Jr.’s story is a case in point.&nbsp;He suffered from both dyslexia and dysphoria, which made life very difficult for him at school, especially when he was still dealing with the bullies in his class.&nbsp;His parents, Ted and Jeanette Ginn, were little aware of his condition.&nbsp;They could not have imagined that their son, who came to the family on April 12, 1985, suffered from such an illness.&nbsp;Ted’s deficiency became clearer after he was diagnosed in high school.</span></p><p><span>After his diagnosis, Ted Grinn became a special student at Glenville High School as each teacher wanted to help him progress and learn faster.&nbsp;They took their time and gave him extra classes after school and over time Ted got faster and brighter.&nbsp;On the field, he was extremely fortunate to be under the supervision of his father, who was the school’s coach.&nbsp;Within a short time he was both a sprinter and a footballer.</span></p><p><span>His full name is Theodore Ginn Jr. and he has two other siblings named Tiffany Grinn (sister) and Jason Lucas (brother).&nbsp;The story documents the fact that Ted Ginn Sr. laid a solid athletic foundation for his son who has gone on to become one of the best multi-position football players in NFL history.&nbsp;Ted Sr was a successful athlete who enjoyed turning youth into professionals and founded his own institution called Ginn Academy, a boys-only school.</span></p><p><span>As his athleticism increased, Ted had to choose football over distance.&nbsp;As a student-athlete, knowledgeable about his games, he was tried in a variety of positions.&nbsp;Often he was in action in most of his games as a defender, wide angler and quarterback.&nbsp;Though he’s still a work in progress due to his diagnosis, he’s outsmarted most of his peers on the field and has received numerous accolades, including honors as MVP for the US Army All-American Bowl Game.</span></p><span>Surprisingly, it wasn’t as a footballer that counted for his admission to Ohio State University, but his accomplishments as a sprinter did.&nbsp;He was due to represent the school at the 2008 Summer Olympics but had to focus on furthering his career as a football player with the Olympics reportedly a long way away.&nbsp;With the Ohio State University football team, he took the position of fullback but later became the team’s receiver.</span><p><span>Inasmuch as Ted Ginn Jr. employed most of his striving to be a successful soccer player, he was also making good progress in his college studies, taking courses in human development and family studies.&nbsp;After racking up several electrifying performances and awards throughout his college career, he decided to turn pro in 2007.&nbsp;That same year, he was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the first round of the NFL draft that year.&nbsp;He played with the team for two years before moving to the San Francisco 49ners after being traded from his previous team.</span></p><p><span>Shortly thereafter, he joined the Carolina Panthers, where he only played with the team for a year, showing his athletic ability with the Arizona Cardinals before returning to the Panthers.&nbsp;Currently he has broken many records with the New Orleans Saints</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-%e2%80%93-woman></span><strong><span>family – woman</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Ted Ginn Jr. found love with Krystle McCoy Ginn.&nbsp;The two met sometime in 2002 and since then their love has been said to shine as bright as the sun.</span></p><p><span>Initially, they didn’t have a marriage checklist, but later chose to officiate their union on April 12, 2015, five years after they welcomed their twin babies, Theodore Ginn III and Krysten Lee Ginn.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-weight></span><strong><span>height and weight</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Ted Ginn Jr. isn’t actually one of the greatest athletes to play for the National Football League.&nbsp;He stands at 5 feet 11 inches with a corresponding weight of 82 kg.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wealth-income-and-earnings></span><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Having played for many clubs in the national football league, nothing less is expected from the footballer.&nbsp;He has made an enormous amount of money with each of these teams and has also made a great fortune from his career.&nbsp;He’s worth an estimated $5 million.</span></p><p class=postsid
