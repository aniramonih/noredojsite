She has been accused of crash dieting, and there were reports that she was using <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow’s scam trainer</a>. Now she has come out in defense of her weight loss and explained that it is in preparation for her new role as Black Widow in Iron Man 2. She refutes the claims that she is using Gwynnie’s trainer (never met her) and that she has lost 14 pounds (“If I were to lose 14 pounds, I’d have to part with both arms. And a foot.”)</p><p>While training for an upcoming film, I’ve come to this conclusion: chin ups are near impossible and lunges suck. There is no magic wand to wave over oneself to look good in a latex catsuit. Eating healthy and getting fit is about commitment, determination, consistency and the dedication to self-preservation. While I’ve never been considered a gym rat, I have, in fact, worked up a sweat in the name of cardio before, and although I enjoy a grilled cheese as much as the next person, I combine the not-so-good foods I crave with an all-around balanced diet.</p><p>People come in all shapes and sizes and everyone has the capability to meet their maximum potential. Once filming is completed, I’ll no longer need to rehash the 50 ways to lift a dumbbell, but I’ll commit to working out at least 30 minutes a day and eating a balanced diet of fruit, vegetables and lean proteins. Pull ups, crunches, lunges, squats, jumping jacks, planks, walking, jogging and push ups are all exercises that can be performed without fancy trainers or gym memberships. I’ve realized through this process that no matter how busy my life may be, I feel better when I take a little time to focus on staying active. We can all pledge to have healthy bodies no matter how diverse our lifestyles may be.</p><p>Since dedicating myself to getting into “superhero shape,” several articles regarding my weight have been brought to my attention. Claims have been made that I’ve been on a strict workout routine regulated by co-stars, whipped into shape by trainers I’ve never met, eating sprouted grains I can’t pronounce and ultimately losing 14 pounds off my 5’3″ frame. Losing 14 pounds out of necessity in order to live a healthier life is a huge victory. I’m a petite person to begin with, so the idea of my losing this amount of weight is utter lunacy. If I were to lose 14 pounds, I’d have to part with both arms. And a foot. I’m frustrated with the irresponsibility of tabloid media who sell the public ideas about what we should look like and how we should get there.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Huffington Post</a>]</p><p>Scarlett also criticizes tabloids for being so obsessed with her weight, and worries that this hooplah will inspire bad habits in her fans.</p><p>The concept of ‘Stars Are Just Like Us!” makes us feel connected to lifestyles that can sometime seem out of this world. Yes, celebrities are just like us. They struggle with demons and overcome obstacles and have annoying habits and battle vices. That said, I would be absolutely mortified to discover that some 15-year-old girl in Kansas City read one of these “articles” and decided she wasn’t going to eat for a couple of weeks so she too could “crash diet” and look like Scarlett Johansson.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Huffington Post</a>]</p><p>Scarlett makes a good point. Hollywood, and those that follow celebrities, are very concerned with looks and particularly the stars’ weight. But in Scarlett’s case, it was concern over her health and inspiration as a beautiful, curvy girl rather than “oh great, she’s finally dropped the pounds!” She was never large by any sense of the word, but she had curves and a chest and cute cheeks. In comparison to most of the other starlets in Hollywood (like Megan Fox, with her patented sultry look and fake boobs), Scarlett looked like a normal gorgeous girl. I can understand why she’s lost weight to fit into a lycra suit as the bad guy in a new action movie, but I can only hope that when the filming ends, she does just as she says she will and gets back to her old shape, while still keeping healthy – ultimately, the most important thing.</p><p>Here’s Scarlett at the Moet and Chandon: A Tribute to Cinema party held at Big Sky in London on March 24th.
