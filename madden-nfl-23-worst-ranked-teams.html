But the game also boasts improvements in the gameplay and other tricks as EA is answering fan issues with the game over the years. What hasn't changed is the buzz over the rankings, as every Madden game always sparks discussion on how they rate teams and players.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Best Madden NFL Video Games Ever, Ranked (According To Metacritic)</a></span></p><p>As with any pre-season discussion, much of it is based on the previous season and is so hard to tell how a team will fare this year. The overall ratings for teams are intriguing as some can boast a good offense but bad defense and vice versa, not to mention the star power on board. As it stands now, these are the lowest-rated teams for Madden 23 and might be more of a challenge for gamers to use in the coming installment.</p><h2 id=pittsburgh-steelers-80><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Pittsburgh Steelers: 80</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TJ-Watt.jpg><p>After so long as the dominant force in the AFC North, the Steelers have slumped poorly in the last few years. With <a href=#>Ben Roethlisberger retired</a> and a new direction, the Steelers are hoping to get back to form, but the ratings show their issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's actually been some controversy over T.J. Watts getting a fantastic 96 rating yet trailing behind Myles Garrett. Also, Cameron Heyward has 93 and the defense a terrific 87, which should make for a great team. On the flip side, new QB Mitchell Trubisky is only 69 and a few others on the offensive line are tricky. Still, the Steelers are the best team on this list, even if lower than several others.</p><h2 id=carolina-panthers-79><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Carolina Panthers: 79</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/USA_christianmccaffrey.jpg><p>The Panthers are one team on this list that can boast a member with a rating over 90, <a href=#>Christian McCaffrey</a> at 96. That's a far cry from Baker Mayfield at 77, although D.J. Moore is an excellent 88.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> 10 Current NFL Players Who Would Be Better Off On New Teams</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the Panthers do boast some of the game's fastest players in Kalon Barnes, Amaré Barno and Brian Burns, which can spark them up more. That can aid the team in the next year depending on their schedule as the Panthers are hoping to return to their past glory even if they have to be in the lower rungs of the ratings in Madden 23.</p><h2 id=new-york-jets-79><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>New York Jets: 79</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/USATSI_17514719_168397659_lowres.jpg><p>It's easy to slam the Jets, so no shock they're among the lower-rated teams in Madden 23. On the plus side, <a href=#>Sauce Gardner</a> is rated high among Madden 23 rookies at 78.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, the Jets have a few well-rated players with Quinnen Williams (86), Carl Lawson (83) and C. J. Mosley (82) and a surprisingly strongly rated defense at 79. On the other hand, Zach Wilson is only 73 and their offense is good but not stellar. It seems the Jets land this low mostly because…well, they're the Jets, and it'll take a lot to see their rating rise this season.</p><h2 id=chicago-bears-78><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Chicago Bears: 78</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/USATSI_15275824_168397659_lowres-(1).jpg><p>After dumping both coach Matt Nagy and long-suffering GM Ryan Pace, the Bears are hoping to rebound in the NFC North this season. Justin Fields is still rated lower at 74, with their best player being <a href=#>Roquan Smith</a> at 89 with David Montgomery at 84.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Predicting The 10 Worst NFL Teams Of The 2022 Season</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While special teams are good at 75, the offense is a poor 69 and the Bears' defense took a hit to 75. The Bears are hopeful for a better year but that's not rubbing off yet on their Madden 23 rating.</p><h2 id=detroit-lions-78><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Detroit Lions: 78</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/USATSI_17229428_168397659_lowres-(1)-1.jpg><p>After years of being the joke of the NFC North,<a href=#> the Lions pulled off the coup </a>of drafting both Aidan Hutchinson and Jameson Williams in the first round. That alone gives them a boost, with Williams ranked 78 and Hutchinson 77. The best overall Lions player is T.J. Hockenson at 87, with Jared Goff rated 72.</p><p>While Bruce Hector is a pitiful 59, the rest of the Lions squad is in the 70s and even low-80s range, better than past years. Yet it's Hutchinson and Williams alone who can give hope for the Lions for the coming year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jacksonville-jaguars-77><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jacksonville Jaguars: 77</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lawrence-4-©-Steve-Roberts-USA-TODAY-Sports.jpg><p>One would think after so many first-round picks, the Jaguars would have built a decent team by now, but it hasn't happened. They did land Travon Walker who rates 76, a high ranking among rookies.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Worst Picks Of The 2022 NFL Draft</a></span></p><p><a href=#>QB Trevor Lawrence</a> gets a 76, while their best player is Brandon Scherff with 87. Marvin Jones Jr (82) and Christian Kirk (81) are both good wide receivers, although their defensive line is lower rated. A factor is Ryan Santosto one of the lower-rated kickers at 66. It's more their history that drives the Jaguars this low in the ratings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=atlanta-falcons-77><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Atlanta Falcons: 77</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/USATSI_17412929_168397659_lowres-(2).jpg><p>After a few dismal seasons, the Falcons are hoping to regroup but seem to lack the right tools to do it. With Matt Ryan gone, <a href=#>new QB Marcus Mariota</a> rates 71. However, Atlanta does have a great selection of promising talent, with A.J. Terrell Jr. (89), Kyle Pitts (87) and Casey Hayward Jr. (87), which can work out.</p><p>While their defense is on the low side, the Falcons do have a well-rated offense and if Mariota shows some improvement, could raise up a bit in the ratings. For now, Atlanta is the epitome of a "rebuilding year" for Madden.</p><h2 id=seattle-seahawks-76><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Seattle Seahawks: 76</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/tyler-lockett.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A classic case of a team in flux, the Seahawks bidding farewell to<a href=#> Russell Wilson</a> closes the book on their Super Bowl glory period. That's likely the reason their team rating for Madden 23 is so low. The good is that Tyler Lockett and Jamal Adams both rating 90 overall.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 NFL Starters Who Should Be Benched</a></span></p><p>The bad is Drew Lock is a dismal 66, which is still better than Geno Smith's 60. Indeed, for every well-rated player the Seahawks have is another with a terrible number and it's still tricky seeing how they'll go. Thus, after so long as a top Madden team, the Seahawks are falling to the bottom of the list.</p><h2 id=new-york-giants-75><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>New York Giants: 75</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Daniel-Jones--Kenny-Golladay.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With their 4-13 2021 season done and Joe Judge gone as head coach, the Giants are hoping to rebound. On the one hand, Madden has a few players with decent ratings like Saquon Barkley (86), Leonard Williams (83) and Adoree' Jackson (82).</p><p><a href=#>But QB Daniel Jones is only 70</a> and a few players like Davis Webb (52) and Justin Hillard (55) are pretty low. Yet Brian Daboll is going to have his hands full trying to spark this team up and get the Giants out of the basement of the NFC East.</p><h2 id=houston-texans-74><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Houston Texans: 74</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/USATSI_17207796.jpg><p>Coming off a horrific 4-13 record, it should be no surprise the Texans get the lowest ranking for Madden '23. Not only that, not a single member of the Texans roster rated 90 or higher. Braden Cooks did get an 87 yet the Texans themselves look rough even without <a href=#>Deshaun Watson</a> as a distraction.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Derek Stingley Jr is rated fifth among promising rookies with a 71. Lovie Smith is hoping to get the team going, but with the lowest-rated defense at 70 and a rough schedule, it's not shocking the Texans are seen as the worst team to handle in Madden 23 and the real NFL.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmedlrGlsc1mpZ%2BkXWeAbsPOq6qtZaKWu6yxw2arnpmdqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./awkward-2014-golden-globes-moments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Most Awkward 2014 Golden Globes Moments">&larr;
