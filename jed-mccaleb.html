His family later relocated to Little Rock, Arkansas, where he spent the majority of his childhood. McCaleb is not the type of person who is open about their family history. He has not revealed who his parents are or whether he has any siblings. He enjoyed technological activities as a child, and it was his dream job after finishing his education.</p><p>He enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, after graduating from high school. However, his desire to become a technician prevented him from completing his education, and he dropped out while still a freshman. He relocated to New York and began his career as a tech entrepreneur.</p><h2>Jed Mccaleb Age, Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Jed McCaleb</strong> was born on June 8, 1975, and is 47 years old as of 2023. His height is 1.6m, and he weighs 76 kg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Jed-Mccaleb-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p><strong>Jed McCaleb</strong> founded his first company, MetalMachine Inc., in 2000, where the eDonkey2000 application was first used. In 2001, he was joined by Sam Yagan, who was appointed CEO while still serving as the company’s CTO. He also created Overnet, a network that collaborated with eDonkey2000 and attracted over 4 million users. However, in 2006, the company agreed with the RIAA to stop the distribution of these networks in exchange for paying the RIAA $30 million to protect them from copyright.</p><p>In 2007, he purchased Mtgox.com, which he later changed to bitcoin in 2010, and the website began to grow. In February, he sold it to Mark Karpeles, remaining a minority owner. The company went bankrupt in 2014.</p><p>In 2011, McCaleb created the Ripple Protocol, a digital currency. Rather than using bitcoin, this system relied on consensus to verify transactions. He appointed Arthur Britto as chief strategist and Chris Larsen as CEO. In 2013, he stepped down from his active role in the company.</p><p>In 2014, he and his partner Joyce Kim co-founded Stellar Development Foundation, which enabled cross-border monetary transactions. It began operations on July 31, 2014, with a $3 million loan from Stripe. He currently serves as the company’s CTO. In the same building as Steller, he launched Lightyear.io, which was linked together to allow global currency exchange. Lightyear later collaborated with IBM. Lightyear merged with Chain.com in September 2018 and was renamed Interstellar.</p><h2>Jed McCaleb Achievements And Awards</h2><p><strong>Jed McCaleb</strong> has accomplished a lot in his life. Despite the fact that he has not received any awards, Forbes has recognized him and placed him in the top 40 richest people in the world. His popularity has grown as a result of his contributions to the world of technology. MIRI recognized him as one of its largest donors and appointed him to its advisory board. In 2018, The New York Times named him one of the top ten leaders in the blockchain revolution.</p><h2>Jed McCaleb’s Net Worth In 2023</h2><p><strong>Jed McCaleb net worth</strong> is estimated to be $20 billion as of November 2023. He has made a living from his various technological network developments. He has held positions of leadership in all of these companies, which have grown and provided him with that amount of money. According to Forbes, he is thus among the wealthiest people. He is likely to make more because he is still eager to do more.</p><p>McCaleb is a successful businessman. He is also very daring because he abandoned his education to pursue his career, but he was extremely fortunate to have achieved more than anyone could have imagined.</p><h2>Jed Mccaleb Wife, Marriage</h2><p><strong>Jed McCaleb</strong> married Misoon Burzlaff after dating her for several years. The couple lived happily ever after and had two children, a son, and a daughter. The family had been living in New York until 2010 when they moved to Williamsburg and then to Upstate Patterson. Their marriage did not last forever, and McCaleb began dating Joyce Kim, who happened to be his lawyer.</p><p>McCaleb found himself on the wrong side of the law after some of his Mt. Gox traders accused him of fraudulently misrepresenting Mt. Gox and forcing traders to use the exchange despite knowing it was insecure. He defended himself, claiming that he had resolved all issues that he was aware of.</p><p>McCaleb also enjoys giving back to society and is one of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute’s (MIRI) largest donors, having donated $500,000. He also contributes to OpenAL.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnpxdorCkrcuemWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jeremy-buendia-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeremy Buendia Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki">&larr;
