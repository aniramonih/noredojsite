It took 65 minutes and the efforts of 59 firefighters to extinguish the blaze.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Firefighters faced significant challenges in accessing and extricating Heche, finally rescuing her after 45 minutes. Unfortunately, she had already suffered severe burns and smoke inhalation injuries.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Law enforcement officials initially reported that Heche acted erratically and under the influence during the crashes.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Screenshot-2154.png><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A preliminary blood analysis revealed the presence of cocaine and narcotics, including fentanyl.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, further tests were needed to determine whether these substances were ingested before the incident or administered during her hospital treatment.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After months of investigation, the final autopsy results indicated that illicit substances did not impair Heche at the crash. An inactive metabolite of cocaine was found, suggesting prior use but not recent consumption.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Cannabinoids were detected in her urine, indicating previous usage. Fentanyl was also present, attributed to hospital treatment rather than pre-crash ingestion.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Heche was hospitalized and remained in critical condition, ultimately succumbing to an anoxic brain injury. She was kept on life support temporarily to assess organ viability for donation, to she expressed a wish.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After suitable organ recipients were identified, Anne Heche’s life support was peacefully withdrawn on August 14, 2022.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The medical examiner concluded that her passing was primarily due to inhalation and thermal injuries, with blunt trauma noted as a secondary contributing factor.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>An honor walk was held in memory of Anne Heche’s organ donation, and her cremated remains were interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery on May 14, 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>You May Also Like: </strong><a href=# rel=bookmark>Benjamin Bratt Kids: Meet Daughter Sophia Rosalinda And Son Mateo Bravery Bratt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK571pqqZpmeo7JutMScn55lkp69sLjAq2SmnZ6prq15x56YpayYYsKxsMCtnGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./daniella-monet-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Daniella Monet Net Worth 2024: A Deep Dive into Career, Earnings and Financial Journey">&larr;
