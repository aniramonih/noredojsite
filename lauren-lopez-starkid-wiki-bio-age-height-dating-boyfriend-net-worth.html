She is a 33 year-old actress, dancer and singer, primarily recognized for her involvement with the ‘Starkid’ theatre production company. Lauren and Starkid became famous after their Harry Potter parody play “A Very Potter Musical” became an internet sensation. Beside this, she is known for her roles in “Edgar Allan Poe’s Murder Mystery Dinner Party”, “Firebringer” and “The Trail to Oregon!” Her acting career has been active since 2006.</p><h2><span id=Lauren_Lopez_Bio_Early_Life_Family_and_Education>Lauren Lopez Bio: Early Life, Family and Education</span></h2><p>Lauren Lopez spent most of her early childhood growing-up with her younger brother in her hometown of Royal Oak, before moving to New York and later Chicago. Lauren has stated that she was lively and joyous as a child, and one of her favorite pastime activities with her brother and friends was the game they called ‘hamming’, which consisted of buying slices of ham and throwing them at windows and trees to see if they will stick to it. Having matriculated from high school she enrolled at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor where she studied theatre arts. Needless to say, her talent and passion for acting and performing were quickly noticed by both professors and her fellow students, and she was soon invited to be a part of a student group that called themselves ‘Starkid productions’. Many of the members of the group would later become successful and recognized performers and actors, such as Darren Criss who was one of Lauren’s closest friends and associates, who went on to star in several seasons of the hit musical show “Glee”. Darren and Lauren both wrote for and performed in various plays, internet videos and music albums that were published under the name of Starkid productions. Lauren graduated with honors with a degree in theatre.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings_and_Starkid_Production>Career Beginnings and ‘Starkid Production’</span></h2><p>While at college Lauren also landed minor roles in films “The Spiral Project” and “Clowns on Earth”, before joining the soon-to-become famous group Starkid productions, or ‘Team StarKid’, created in 2009 by Lauren’s classmates Darren Criss, Matt Lang, Nick Lang and Brian Holden. The group had a solid local following, and quickly became popular among their peers and professors, however, they gained international attention and internet fame after their humorous adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s bestseller “Harry Potter” series, which they called “A Very Potter Musical”. The story for the musical was composed out of several plot pieces from the “Harry Potter” books and films, but also featured original content, original songs and more adult humor and dirty jokes. Lauren Lopez played the role of Draco Malfoy, one of the series’ main villains. The play was uploaded onto YouTube and became a viral sensation, garnering millions of views on the platform and launching the group to fame. The musical was included in the ’10 Best Viral Videos of 2009’ list by ‘Entertainment Weekly’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/tumblr_ouj0qovpH81wxl2x4o4_1280-1024x576.png><p>Following this huge success, Lauren worked with her ‘Starkid’ group on eight original musicals. In some she appeared as an actress, while in others she was included in the writing or soundtrack production – some of the most popular ‘Starkid’ shows in which Lauren participated included “Me and My Dick”, “A Very Potter Sequel”, “Starship”, “Holy Musical <a href=# class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=0745476a6669>[email&nbsp;protected]</a>!” and “A Very Potter Senior Year”. With each new production the popularity of the group grew – their musical theatre parody shows consisted of both originally created stories as well as pop-culture parodies of famous cartoons and movies, such as “Batman”, “Star Wars”, “Aladdin” and “The Oregon Trail”. In addition to musicals, Lauren also took part in the group’s two national tours – “The SPACE Tour” in 2011 and “Apocalyptour” in 2012, as well as partnerships with ‘The Second City & Improv Olympic’ held in Chicago. The popularity of their YouTube videos brought them international fame as well, resulting in the group visiting England, Ireland and Germany where they performed their most popular musicals and sketches.</p><h2><span id=Film_and_Television_and_Later_Work>Film and Television and Later Work</span></h2><p>In addition to her involvement with ‘Starkid’, Lauren Lopez has built quite an impressive resume when it comes to film and television.

Recently she starred in the science fiction series “Sona” and the musical comedy film “The Guy Who Didn’t Like Musicals”. She has recently finished filming her new series entitled “The Wayward Guide for the Untrained Eye”, and in addition she has a new series called “Stellar People” on the way.</p><p>Even though she has been quite busy with her film and television roles, Lauren hasn’t neglect her theatre career; as a matter of fact, she has just recently finished a run of “The Tempest” and “The Solve-It Squad Returns” in Los Angeles.</p><p>Over the years, she has also appeared in numerous adverts for several companies such as Intel, Toys R Us, Bank of America and KMart.</p><p>Besides acting, Lauren’s professional career also includes theater audition coaching and choreographing; she offers monologue coaching either in person or via Skype.</p><p>Lauren has also published a cookbook entitled “These Treats Don’t Suck: A Gluten (And Dairy!)
