Kevin Sorbo has a net worth of $14 million. He has also been in Christian films including "God's Not Dead" and "Let There Be Light."

To help pay for his tuition, Sorbo did some work as a model for television and print advertisements. By the mid-80s, he was traveling around Europe and Australia appearing in television commercials. Among the brands he promoted was Jim Beam bourbon whiskey.</p><p>Sorbo made his acting debut in 1988, playing the role of Barry in an episode of the HBO sitcom "1st & Ten." In the early 90s, he was in episodes of the NBC soap opera "Santa Barbara," the popular sitcom "Cheers," the crime drama "Murder, She Wrote," and the dramedy "The Commish."</p><h2 id=breakthrough-hercules><strong>Breakthrough as Hercules</strong></h2><p>In 1994, Sorbo debuted his breakthrough role as the Ancient Greek mythical demigod Hercules in a series of five television films. The films were "Hercules and the Amazon Women," "Hercules and the Lost Kingdom," "Hercules and the Circle of Fire," "Hercules in the Underworld," and "Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur." The major ratings success of these films spawned the television series "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys," which began airing in syndication in January of 1995. It ended up running for six season, making Sorbo an international star in the process. Additionally, the actor directed two episodes of the series and cowrote one as well.</p><p>The success of "Hercules" led to the popular spinoff series "Xena: Warrior Princess," starring <a href=# title="Lucy Lawless Net Worth">Lucy Lawless</a>. Sorbo appeared as Hercules in two episodes of "Xena," and also lent his voice to the animated film "Hercules and Xena â€“ The Animated Movie: The Battle for Mount Olympus."</p><h2 id=further-television-career><strong>Further Television Career</strong></h2><p>Following the end of "Hercules," Sorbo played the leading role of Captain Dylan Hunt on the science-fiction drama series "Andromeda," which ran from 2000 to 2005. During this time, he also appeared in four episodes of "Dharma & Greg," and was in episodes of "According to Jim" and "Hope & Faith." In 2006, Sorbo took on a recurring role in the final season of "The O.C." The next year, he starred in the Lifetime Channel film "Last Chance CafÃ©," the Hallmark Channel film "Avenging Angel," and guest-starred as a bounty hunter on the detective series "Psych."

He also made appearances as himself on the shows "The Guild" and "Don't Trust the Bâ€”â€” in Apartment 23."

Four years later, he had his first leading role in the fantasy film "Kull the Conqueror." In the 2000s, Sorbo was in the drama "Clipping Adam," and played Nick Prescott in the direct-to-video action thrillers "Walking Tall: The Payback" and "Walking Tall: Lone Justice." Other credits around this time included "Meet the Spartans," "Prairie Fever," "An American Carol," and "Bitch Slap."</p><p>Sorbo had a prolific run of roles in the 2010s. Among his credits were "What Ifâ€¦," "Tales of an Ancient Empire," "Paradox," "Soul Surfer," "Storm Rider," "Caged No More," "Rodeo Girl," and "Spirit of the Game." Additionally, Sorbo starred in five direct-to-video fantasy films in the "Mythica" series: "A Quest for Heroes," "The Darkspore," "The Necromancer," "The Iron Crown," and "The Godslayer." It was during this time that the actor also got heavily involved in Christian-themed films, such as "God's Not Dead" and "Let There Be Light," the latter of which he also directed. Another Christian film he was in, called "The Girl Who Believes in Miracles," came out in 2021.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-167117 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Kevin-Sorbo.jpg alt="Kevin Sorbo Net Worth" width=594 height=476 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-167117 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick M.

He was weakened for many years, and was left with a permanent 10% loss of vision. Sorbo went on to raise awareness about stroke, and received the Public Leadership in Neurology Award from the American Academy of Neurology for his efforts.</p><h2 id=political-religious-views><strong>Political and Religious Views</strong></h2><p>Sorbo has drawn much criticism and notoriety for his outlandish and dangerous political beliefs. He is a supporter of <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a>, and has perpetuated the disproven conspiracy theory that liberals led the attempted insurrection at the US Capitol in 2021.

In 2014 he was renting the house for as much as $275,000 per month in summer months. At one point a renter was busted using the house to throw massive for-profit parties at the mansion. The town had to step in and order Sorbo to put an end to the parties.</p><p>In 2012 Kevin put the home on the market for $10.5 million. That number proved to be optimistic. He removed the listing then re-listed in 2017 for $6.5 million then $4.9 million then back up to $5.3 million. As of this writing he still owns the 5-acre estate:</p><p></p><p>In 2008 Kevin paid $3.2 million for a home in Westlake Village, California. He listed this home for sale in 2014 for $4.5 million.
