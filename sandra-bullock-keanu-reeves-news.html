They went on to become good friends and star in another movie together, the 2006 romance The Lake House. But, even though they've been a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>great match on screen</a>, Reeves and Bullock never dated in real life. That doesn't mean they were never interested in dating each other, though.</p><p>Reeves was recently <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>profiled for Esquire magazine</a>, and Bullock was asked about her connection with him. The actor shared her reason for never dating her co-star during their nearly 30 years of knowing each other and also talked about why he means so much to her as a friend. Read on to find out why Bullock and Reeves got together romantically, even though they shared a mutual crush.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>15 Onscreen Couples You Totally Forgot Dated in Real Life</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Sandra-Keanu.jpg><p>The Esquire interview notes that Bullock has always said that dating Reeves could have ruined their friendship, which is important to her. In the new interview, though, she explained that maybe things could have worked out, since Reeves tends to get along with his exes. "Keanu's a guy who, I feel like, is friends with every woman he's ever dated," Bullock said. "I don't think there's anyone who has something horrible to say about him. So maybe we could have survived. I don't know."<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>But, she continued, "[W]e didn't have to survive anything. We just get to grow up together on parallel roads and tip our hats and meet for a dinner and try to work together. And the longer time goes on, the more in awe I am of the human being. Would I have been able to say that if he had dumped me and made me angry? Probably not."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Sandra-Keanu-Oscars.jpg><p>Bullock told Esquire that Reeves is a "listener" and it "drives. People. Crazy." She shared a story about telling the Matrix&nbsp;actor early in their friendship that she had never tried champagne and truffles. A few days later, he showed up at her house on his motorcycle with champagne and truffles, plus flowers.</p><p class=p1>"That's what I mean that it drives you crazy," she said. "When I first met him, I would spend as much time as I could filling a silence, just to feel comfortable. And the more I jibber-jabbered on, the quieter he would get. And I thought, <i>I don't understand what's happening! He's looking at me with eyes of confusion. He's quiet. Did I say something to offend him?&nbsp;</i>And then a day or two later, he would arrive with a note or a little package, saying, 'I thought about what you said.' And he would have his response."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Sandra-ellen.png><p>During a 2018 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Bullock was asked</a> about what memories she has of working on the 1994 action movie. "I think about how sweet Keanu Reeves was and how handsome he was," she responded. "It was hard for me to really be serious. He would look at me and I would be like [giggles]."</p><p>Asked if they dated, she said with a laugh, "Never dated him. There was something about me that I guess he didn't like." She added, "I think we're probably friends for that long because we didn't."</p><p class=p1><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Keanu-ellen.png><p>During his on interview on&nbsp;Ellen in 2019, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Reeves was shown Bullock talking about their relationship</a> and said that he'd had no idea she had ever felt that way about him.</p><p>"She obviously didn't know I had a crush on her either," he added. Reeves said they didn't share their feelings because "[they] were working," but added, "It was nice to go to work, and she's such a wonderful person."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Keanu-Sandra-premiere.jpg><p>These days, Reeves is dating artist <strong>Alexandra Grant</strong> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Bullock is dating</a> photographer<strong> Bryan Randall</strong>. Plus, it's clear they're just great friends now, so don't hold out hope that they'll ever get together. But, if Bullock has her way, fans will see them together again on screen someday.</p><p>"I would love nothing more than to do a comedy with Keanu before we die," she told Esquire. "Just laugh with him. He's funny. We can be 75â€”it'll be even better then, like an old-people <i>Cocoon</i>&nbsp;thing. We play two funny old people. A road trip. Just put us in an RV as old people. It'll be the bookend of&nbsp;<i>Speed</i>! We'll just be driving really slowly. Pissing the world off. There's our movie."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Will Smith Just Admitted He Fell in Love With This Co-Star While Married</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmrJmemb%2BiecGuo6Wnk6B6rLHAp6xmqpWaw6a%2FjKecsKtf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./scarlett-johansson-defends-her-weight-loss-in-huffington-post-article.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Scarlett Johansson defends her weight loss in Huffington Post article">&larr;
