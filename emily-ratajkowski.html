Ratajkowski, who was born with the desire to become an actor, quickly followed her dream.</p><p>After a few roles as a child artist, she transitioned to modeling during her adolescence and has been a sought-after face ever since. Ratajkowski’s openness to everything, including nudity, set her apart from other models.</p><p>Her uninhibited attitude stems from her frequent visits to Europe’s nude beaches as a child, which had a profound impact on her young mind.</p><p>Her appearance on the cover of an erotic magazine, in 2012, was instrumental in her bagging a role in the record-breaking music video, ‘Blurred Lines’.</p><p>Interestingly, Ratajkowski had previously rejected the offer and only agreed to do it after much persuasion. The video launched her career and turned her into an overnight sensation.</p><p>Numerous photoshoots followed, as did runway success, top rankings in beauty and fashion lists, appearances on the covers of the world’s top magazines, and even big screen appearances—her ‘prized’ dream all along.</p><p>Meanwhile, her daring appearance and fashion sense earned her a large following—both on and off social media.</p><p>Ratajowski has appeared in numerous films, including ‘Entourage,’ ‘We Are Your Friends,’ and ‘I Feel Pretty,’ among others, and there are many more in the works.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Emily_Ratajkowski_Age></span><strong>Emily Ratajkowski</strong> Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Emily O’Hara Ratajkowski is 32 years old as of 2023, she was born in Westminster, London, on June 7, 1991.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_of_Emily_Ratajkowski></span><strong>Early Life of Emily Ratajkowski</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Emily-Ratajkowski.jpg><p>Emily O’Hara Ratajkowski was born in Westminster, London, on June 7, 1991, to Kathleen Balgley and John David.</p><p>She was the couple’s only child.

Ratajkowski spent a significant amount of time in Europe as a child.</p><p>Visiting nude beaches in Europe during her formative years exposed Ratajkowski to the nude female figure in photography and art. The works of prominent photographers, including her father’s, had a profound influence on Emily as a child.</p><p>Ratajkowski lived in London for the first five years of her life before relocating to San Diego, California. Ratajkowski had become obsessed with the theatre before leaving London.</p><p>Her love for acting found her the debut role of Elsa in the adaptation, ‘The Little Match Girl’. She then took on a few roles, tried her hand at ballet, and eventually began modeling.</p><p>Ratajkowski attended San Dieguito Academy High School in San Diego while pursuing a modeling and acting career in Los Angeles.
