He shyly approached her, onsetting what has now become marital bliss.</p><p class=Eg>In October 2022, Dillon Carmichael married the love of his life, Shayla Witson. The couple's nuptials occurred during an afternoon ceremony in Frankfurt, Kentucky, surrounded by friends and family.</p><p class=Eg>Whitson donned a stunning white gown with a large round tail. With her blonde hair styled in large curls and parted midway, a lengthy veil with lace detail around the hem rested on her crown, trailing behind her as she enjoyed her big day.</p><p class=Eg>Her husband looked handsome in a black tuxedo. Following <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/country/dillon-carmichael-marries-shayla-whitson-wedding-photos/><u>the ceremony</u></a>, the couple returned to Austin City Saloon, where they first met, for an extended reception. They enjoyed a weeklong honeymoon in Costa Rica afterward and have been living in marital bliss ever since.</p><p><h2 class=Ig><strong class=Cg>Dillon Carmicheal's Wife, Shayla Whitson, Studied Hospitality</strong></h2></p><p class=Eg>Whitson graduated with a degree in Hospitality Management and Tourism from the University of Kentucky in 2018. She celebrated her achievement on Instagram, sharing a few photos from her graduation day that May.</p><p class=Eg>The first picture shows her smiling as she sits cross-legged, wearing a blue graduation gown and white sash draped around her neck. The second shows her happily high-fiving her friend, another graduate, on a staircase.</p><p class=Eg>"Highly recommend graduating in 3 years," she <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BiiShsaH1jL/?hl=en"><u>wrote</u></a> alongside the celebratory photos. Following graduation, Whitson developed much experience <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.linkedin.com/in/shayla-carmichael-42701ab5/><u>in sales management</u></a> at several companies, particularly at 21c Museum Hotel in Nashville.
