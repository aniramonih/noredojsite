Morphew’s absence caused a statewide search operation in which hundreds of volunteers participated, but Suzanne was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Reportedly $200,000 award was announced to find the missing woman, but sadly, everybody failed to find the Maysville resident. It was speculated that somebody abducted the woman and then killed her, but there was no evidence to prove this assumption.</p><p>Fingers were pointed against Suzanne’s husband, <a href=# rel=noopener>Barry Morphew</a>, who was even prosecuted, but the case was dismissed due to the absence of concrete evidence. Recently, Police found Suzanne’s remains at Moffat on September 27, 2023.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Barry Morphew's Late Wife Suzanne Morphew" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Barry-Morphews-Late-Wife-Suzanne-Morphew.webp alt="Barry Morphew's Late Wife Suzanne Morphew" width=400 height=473 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>When did Suzanne Morphew Go Missing?</strong></h2><p>On May 10, 2020, Suzanne Morphew, a resident of Maysville, vanished after setting out for a bike ride on Mother’s Day. The events that unfolded after that remain shrouded in mystery. Her bicycle was discovered down a steep ravine off Chaffee County Road 225 from Highway 50.</p><p>Deputies observed that the bicycle showed no signs of a crash and no evidence of blood at the scene. Following her disappearance, Barry Morphew, her husband, stated in an interview that he believed she had been abducted.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Suzanne Morphew remains found" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Suzanne-Morphew-remains-found.webp alt="Suzanne Morphew remains found" width=450 height=387 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Suzanne Remains Found</strong></h2><p>Three years after her disappearance, agents from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation made a sad discovery: human remains confirmed to be Suzanne Morphew. During an investigation related to a separate case, CBI agents came across the remains in an area in Moffat.</p><p>The location where Suzanne’s remains were found is approximately 120 kilometers from where she initially went missing. Chaffee County Sheriff confirmed that the El Paso County Coroner positively identified the remains as belonging to Suzanne Morphew.</p><p>However, specific details regarding the location of the discovery and the circumstances surrounding her demise are being withheld due to legal considerations.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Suzanne Morphew husband Barry Morphew arrested" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Suzanne-Morphew-husband-Barry-Morphew-arrested.webp alt="Suzanne Morphew husband Barry Morphew arrested" width=400 height=528 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Fingers Pointed At Barry Morphew<br></strong></h2><p>As the investigation into her vanishing unfolded, friends informed detectives that Suzanne and Barry had been engaged in disputes regarding financial matters, and there were suggestions that Suzanne might have had a boyfriend.</p><p>Investigators obtained documents from Suzanne’s iCloud account as part of the evidence. One of these documents was a list Suzanne compiled on May 8, 2020, titled “Grievances.” The list contained entries such as the wedding ring, which Barry allegedly took and later melted.</p><p>Suzanne also made notes about women on Facebook, which Barry encouraged for business purposes, and an incident in Mexico where Barry attempted to seize her phone to inspect it.</p><p>On May 6, 2020, Suzanne sent Barry a definitive text indicating her desire to end their relationship. This text was discovered in Barry’s cache, suggesting an attempt to delete it.</p><p>Adding to the intrigue, it was revealed that a day before her disappearance, Mrs. Morphew had a lengthy conversation with a man who appeared to be her boyfriend.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Suzanne Morphew husband Barry Morphew crying" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Suzanne-Morphew-husband-Barry-Morphew-crying.webp alt="Suzanne Morphew husband Barry Morphew crying" width=400 height=511 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Lawsuit Against Barry Morphew</strong></h2><p>Prosecutors contended that Barry Morphew allegedly took his wife’s life on the evening of May 9, 2020, upon discovering her nearly two-year extramarital affair. They asserted that he then disposed of her body and staged a bicycle crash before leaving Broomfield early the next day for work.</p><p>On the other hand, Morphew has consistently maintained that he left his wife asleep in bed on the morning she went missing, suggesting the possibility of abduction or her choosing to leave. It is worth noting that Barry was supported by his daughters, who believe that their father is innocent.</p><p>Barry endured over five months in jail while authorities seized his property. However, nine days before the scheduled murder trial, all charges against him were dropped.</p><p>This decision came after a judge prohibited prosecutors from presenting most of their key witnesses due to repeated failures in adhering to rules concerning submitting evidence in his favor.</p><p>Notably, this evidence included DNA from an unidentified male linked to s*xual assault cases in various states, discovered in Suzanne Morphew’s SUV, raising the potential involvement of another suspect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Suzanne-Morphew.webp><h2><strong>Suzanne Morphew Family Background</strong></h2><p>On April 30, 1971, Suzanne Morphew (age 49) was born to her father, Gene Moorman, and mother, Adrienne Owen, in Indiana, United States. She grew up in Alexandria with her three siblings, David, Andrew, and Melinda Moorman.</p><p>Suzanne experienced a wonderful childhood. The family was financially stable as her father worked in the military, and her mother ran Gene’s Root Beer.</p><p>She attended Alexandria Monroe High School, graduating in 1989 with flying colors. After schooling, she joined Purdue University, earning a bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Suzanne Morphew husband" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Suzanne-Morphew-husband.webp alt="Suzanne Morphew husband" width=400 height=513 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>How Did Suzanne Meet Barry Morphew?</strong></h2><p>Suzanne and Barry met during school days; they both attended the same school, Alexandria Monroe HS, where Barry was a star baseball player. On August 5, 1994, they both decided to tie the knot and give their relationship a name.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Suzanne Morphew husband Barry Morphew and daughters Mallory and Macy Morphew" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Suzanne-Morphew-husband-Barry-Morphew-and-daughters-Mallory-and-Macy-Morphew.webp alt="Suzanne Morphew husband Barry Morphew and daughters Mallory and Macy Morphew" width=400 height=487 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The wedding happened at Grace Baptist Church, where Pastor Leigh Crockett performed the double ring ceremony. A few years after the wedding, they welcomed two beautiful daughters, Macy and Mallory,&nbsp; into their lives.</p><p>Sadly, Suzanne and Barry’s relationship started falling apart over the years. Melinda Moorman ( Suzanne’s elder sister) says that her younger was not happy due to Barry’s controlling behavior.</p><h3><strong>Suzanne Morphew FAQs</strong></h3><p>Ques: How old was Suzanne Morphew?</p><p>Ans: 49.</p><p>Ques: When was Suzanne Morphew born?</p><p>Ans: April 30, 1971.</p><p>Ques: Where did the Police find Suzanne Morphew’s remains?</p><p>Ans: Moffat.</p><p>Ques: Who are Suzanne Morphew’s parents?</p><p>Ans: Gene Moorman (father) and Adrienne Owen (mother).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsr5WauG%2BvzqZmrK2qlruvsYympquomJrEcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./teen-mom-2-vee-rivera-addresses-pregnancy-rumors-husband-jo-makes-rare-appearance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Teen Mom 2: Vee Rivera addresses pregnancy rumors, husband Jo makes rare appearance">&larr;
