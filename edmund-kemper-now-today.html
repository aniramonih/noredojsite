He sexually assaulted them and killed them to satisfy his fantasies.&nbsp;</p><p>The man, Kemper, was a giant. Some people started dubbing him “Big Ed” because of his towering stature (he was 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighed 280 pounds).</p><p>He killed his mother, or we can say he was a murderer due to his mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite his deep-seated hatred toward her, he was not yet ready to kill his mother. Let’s get to know where <strong><a href=#>Edmund Kemper</a> now today</strong> or is serial killer Edmund Kemper is still alive?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Edmund Kemper now today</h2><p>He admitted his crimes over the phone and is now in California Medical Facility in Vacaville.&nbsp;</p><p>Cameron Britton’s portrayal of legendary American serial killer Edmund Kemper in Netflix’s Mindhunter garnered him a 2018 Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.</p><p>When Kemper initially gave in to his want for blood, he slaughtered the family’s cats. After we murdered his grandparents, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and committed to the maximum security ward at Atascadero State Hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the care he received, he killed several young ladies and members of his own family, including his mother.</p><p>Kemper was eventually arrested as the notorious “Co-ed Killer” after his bloodlust caught up with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Kemper was accused of first-degree murder eight times, but he killed ten people (six female hitchhikers, his grandparents, his mother, and her friend).</p><p>But after all this, he is helping the police and society nowadays.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Helping The FBI to capture other killers</h2><p>Surprisingly, Kemper assisted the FBI in pursuing other serial killers while he was incarcerated.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1970s, when scholars and law enforcement still knew little about their inner workings, the FBI initiated a groundbreaking project in which agents visited prisons to speak with inmates like Kemper to understand their motivations and thought processes better.</p><p>“He offered a <a href=#>wealth</a> of information on the criminals’ motivations. FBI agents uncovered several previously unknown connections between serial killers by looking at their shared histories and traits, “ex-FBI agent and Behavioral Science Unit researcher Bryanna Fox remarked.</p><p>Over the years, Kemper has given numerous fascinating interviews and has become one of the most infamous killers in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn’t want to lead an everyday life while serving his time at California Medical Facility in Vacaville.</p><p>&nbsp;“His view is that he — and this is his belief — no one’s ever going to let him out,” his attorney stated in 2007, describing his client’s outlook on life behind bars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Helping Blind Community&nbsp;</h2><p>Volunteers of Vacaville was a program that included Edmund Kemper and other inmates, according to a 1987 Los Angeles Times article (via Oxygen).&nbsp;</p><p>This group, so claims Book Riot, is responsible for launching The Blind Project.</p><p>The blind and the jailed are two groups it aims to assist. The group, including Braille transcription, teaches inmates various skills, and in exchange, they deliver audiobooks to the blind.</p><p>Kemper’s voice was used for countless audiobooks, including “Star Wars,” “Flowers in the Attic,” and many more. Specifically, he recorded approximately 5,000 hours between 1977 and 1987. Kemper got not one, but two trophies for his efforts and afterward expressed pride in his achievements on behalf of the company.</p><p>There is still an active Vacaville Volunteers group. However, after a stroke in 2015, Kemper could no longer continue working on The Blind Project.&nbsp;</p><p>The critically praised David Fincher-helmed Netflix series “Mindhunter” depicts some of his life’s events. Ed Kemper has survived the year 2021 and is currently doing time behind bars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final Verdict</h2><p>Serial killer Edmund Kemper is still alive. But we must say whatever he is doing is good for the FBI and society; he did so wrong with so many women, which can not justify. Being human is a fact; we don’t know who is a monster behind an honest and decent face.</p><p>Keep up to date with us for more updates.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCxw6asp5xdoLKuvMSrZKenp2LBsLDAsmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./every-real-housewives-couple-who-filed-for-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Every Real Housewives Couple Who Filed for Divorce">&larr;
