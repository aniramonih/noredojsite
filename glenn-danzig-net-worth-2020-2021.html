Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Glenn Danzig was born in Lodi, New Jersey, the U.S.A. in the year 1955, to a world war veteran father and a sales clerk mother. After returning from his posting in Korea during the war, his father worked as a TV repairman. Glenn was the third child born to his parents and was followed by another child. He spent a part of his life in Revere, Massachusetts.</p><p>It was while staying in this part of the country that he started listening to rock music. According to Glenn Danzig, during this time he had been primarily influenced by bands, like “Black Sabbath”, “The Doors” and “Blue Cheer”. Glenn Danzig’s first encounter with narcotics and alcohol happened at the age of 11, and by 15, he is known to have given up all kinds of drugs altogether.</p><p>He was also an avid reader and was especially interested in horror stories. He read classics, like Edgar Allan Poe. He also had a keen interest in comics, but eventually got bored of conventional comics and started writing his comic strips. The recurring themes in his creations were violence and erotica. Glenn Danzig went to the Lodi High School from where he graduated in 1973.</p><p>After this, he went on to attend the prestigious Tisch School of the Arts at New York University and later enrolled at the New York Institute of Photography. All this while, he aspired to be a comic book creator. It was in the mid-1990s that he started his adult comic book company “Verotic”.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 23 June 1955, Glenn Danzig is 69 years old as of today’s date 21st July 2024. His height is 1.6 m tall, and his weight is 78 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>As a child, Glenn Danzig used to take music lessons, and his musical talents were well established even at that stage. As an amateur, when he was as young as 11 years old, he had started playing with Garage bands. By the time he reached teenage, he had started singing in various local bands that were influenced mainly by the kind of Heavy Metal music that he grew up listening to. His two early bands, which shot him to glory were the “Misfits” and “Samhain”. He joined “Samhain” after completing a few singles and a couple of albums with “Misfits” following a falling out with his bandmates.</p><p>This band got noticed by big labels and finally landed its big break in 1987, after which the name of the band was changed to “Danzig”, to avoid problems in case of any changes in the line-up of the band. Their first album itself created a niche for the band’s musical style, which combined blues and heavy metal. They started shifting into darker music with each successive album, and by 1997, the whole original line up of the band had changed, and they signed up with a new label. In 2003, Glenn Danzig established himself as a patron of dark music by organising the “Blackest of the Black” tour.
