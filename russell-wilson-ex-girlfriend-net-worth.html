Many people believed that she got a large amount in the divorce settlement, but it has not conformed yet. The rumors might also be false, as she might have earned the money because she has been involved in different fields.</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-901 data-method=placement-service></span><p>How often do you watch <a href=#><strong>football</strong></a> matches? If you read this article, you might already be familiar with the American football <a href=#><strong>player</strong></a> <strong>Russell Wilson</strong>. Do you love the way he plays football? Did you know lately he has been progressing a lot? Do you know about his new contract?</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><p>If you are a fan of Russell, there is good news about him. He recently got the contract for an XFL star. Yes, <strong>Ben</strong> <strong>DiNucci</strong> and the <strong>Broncos</strong> agree to give the contract to the player. We hope his off-season knee surgery won't create any problems in his future games and that he will perform at his best.</p><p>After the news, Russell has been a hot topic. Everybody wants to know more about his personal life. Who is he dating? Who is Russell Wilson's ex-girlfriend? So, if you want to know about his love life and his <a href=#><strong>ex-girlfriend</strong></a>'s net worth, read this article.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Earlier, we covered who <a href=#><strong>Sodapoppin</strong></a> was dating and all about <a href=#><strong>Nolan Smith</strong></a>'s girlfriend.</p><h2>Russell Wilsonâ€™s Ex-girlfriend Ashton Meem Has a Net Worth of $4 Million!</h2><p>Many people accused <strong>Russell Wilson</strong>'s (<a href=# rel=noopener>@dangerusswilson</a>) ex-wife, <strong>Ashton Meem</strong>, of receiving a heavy divorce settlement after knowing her net worth. The couple dated for more than eight years before getting married, but their relationship didn't last long. The journey from being a girlfriend to a wife didn't last as long as people expected, which resulted in people accusing her of different things.</p><p><strong>Russell Carrington Wilson</strong> is an American football quarterback for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League. He was <a href=# rel=noopener>inspired</a> toward sports by his father and brother, who were very active football players. He was very active in sports from his school days, and following that, he had a good career in high school and college.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Everyone has their own life; some are still stuck with their past, and some have let go and moved. Do you think it's hard for celebrities to forget their past lives due to the media? In my opinion, yes, people are always ready to pull others' legs, especially one who is famous. Similarly, Russell has still been questioned about his ex-girlfriend and ex-wife, Ashton Meem.</p><p>Who is Ashton Meem? Why are people curious to know about her wealth? Why did she get divorced from Wilson? Aston and Russell knew each other from their high school days. Both of them attended St. Catherine High School, where their relationship got started. They dated for more than eight years before getting married.</p><p>The pair got <a href=# rel=noopener>married</a> at the Country Club of Virginia on January 14, 2012. They were engaged in August 2010 after Russell Wilson was selected in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft. They shared their career success and had faced many ups and downs in their lives, but eventually failed to save their marriage.</p><p><strong><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/russell-wilson-ashton-meen.jpg alt="Russell Wilson and Ashton Meen dated for more than 8 years. celebsfortune.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Russell Wilson and Ashton Meem dated for more than 8 years.</strong><br><strong>Source: Bleacher Report</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-912 data-method=placement-service></span><p>After two years of marriage, Aston and Meem got divorced in April 2014. The real reason was never discussed by anyone and when the press asked Russell, he stated that his decision was a difficult one and requested privacy from the press. However, many people pointed out that Meem cheated on Wilson with his then-Seahawks teammate, <strong>Golden Tate</strong>.</p><h3>What Is the Occupation of Ashton Meem?</h3><p>Unlike <strong>Russell</strong>,<strong> Ashton Meem</strong> has no connection with any sports. She moved to northern California from Virginia and earned a degree from North Carolina State University in communication. After graduating, she started her career as an intern at Lewis Media Partners and McKinney.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Soon, with dedication, Meem got her first job at Richmond-based Morton Consulting as an account executive in 2011. After some time, she was promoted as a major force in the industry before moving to the American Family Insurance Company. As of now, she specializes in advertising operations.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsfortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ashton-meem-russell-wilson.png alt="Russell Wilson's ex Ashton Meem has a net worth of $4 million. celebsfortune.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Russell Wilson's ex Ashton Meem has a net worth of $ 4 million.</strong><br><strong>Source: Pulse Sports Nigeria</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Ashton seems to be a very dedicated person in her life, but after the divorce, her personal and professional lives have taken on a low-key profile. Besides being an advertising operations specialist, she is also a businesswoman with a net worth of 4 million dollars. How did a normal advertising operation specialist become so rich? Is Russell's money also for her? Did she get money for the settlement?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Many think that Ashtoh's half of her net worth is from her former husband, Russell Wilson, whose <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> is more than $165 million. It's not clear whether they did some settlement for the divorce, but people believe that she has definitively something to do with her ex-husband's money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FFqKmtrZ6ae6S7zGiprqujmrmtedaio6ynnmKyuXnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sara-perlman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-98701-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sara Perlman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
