Freeing Orpheus may result in the party becoming <span><span><span>mind flayers</span></span></span>, while siding with the Emperor can mean losing a character.</span></span></span></span><h2>Should you let the emperor assimilate Orpheus?</h2><p>To summarize, players should side with the Emperor if they don’t want to become Mind Flayers, and they should free Orpheus if they don’t mind all the tentacles. The former may cause Lae’zel to turn against the player, and it will force Karlach to return to Avernus so her Infernal Engine doesn’t cause any more problems.</p><h2>What happens if you side with the emperor?</h2><p>By siding with the Emperor, you’ll give the Netherstones to the Emperor. In the end, this means that he’ll fight the brain with you as an ally and then depart in the end, disappearing from the eyes of the world for the foreseeable future.</p><h2>Can you convince the emperor to free Orpheus?</h2><p>I have the hammer–I will free Orpheus.” – This will cause the Emperor to leave so he can be assimilated by the Netherbrain. Once Orpheus is freed, talk to him: “I had no choice. Without your powers, I would have died.”</p><h2>Should I help the emperor in Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2><p>Saving them comes down to a matter of personal preference rather than any clear benefit in terms of gameplay. However, sticking with the Emperor throughout Baldur’s Gate 3 makes more sense for the story unless playing as a githyanki or focusing heavily on aiding the githyanki on that playthrough.</p><h2>What happens when you free Orpheus and betray The Emperor | Baldur’s Gate 3</h2><h2>Does the emperor betray you in BG3?</h2><p>First things first, freeing Orpheus will make the Emperor betray you and join the Netherbrain, since you’re taking away his protection, which means you’ll have to fight him during the final battle.</p><h2>Is the emperor bad in BG3?</h2><p>The Emperor has his good qualities and his bad qualities, but underlying all of it is his clear manipulation of the player. He does not want them in the Githyanki Creche, but if they do go and meet him in the Astral Prism, he kneels and gives them the “power” to kill them, creating an illusion players can trust him.</p><h2>Can I save both Emperor and Orpheus?</h2><p>If you succeed both, they make a truce and you can release Orpheus with Orphic Hammer when you get it without Emperor turning hostile and they both accompany you in final battle (and there are more enemies present to compensate).</p><h2>Can you have both Emperor and Orpheus?</h2><p>Unless i missed something you have to choose to be allied with Orpheus OR the Emperor, there’s no way to have both on the team. The fact that the Emperor doesn’t offer the even the littlest amount of good will towards Orpheus does not make any sense and feels forced.</p><h2>How do you free Orpheus and keep the emperor?</h2><p>There are two paths that help you free Orpheus in Baldur’s Gate 3, either using the Orphic Hammer to break his chains or sacrificing a character to become a Mind Flayer. The Emperor wants to turn Orpheus into a Mind Flayer by eating his brain.</p><h2>Can you free Orpheus without betraying the emperor?</h2><p>You arrive at the prism and need to choose to either free Orpheus or trust the Emperor. And the result of either choice is… nothing. He will betray you on a dime if you decide to free Orpheus, regardless of how much you honded throughout the journey, leading you to believe he was just manipulating you.</p><h2>Is Killing the Emperor good for the Empire Skyrim?</h2><p>Killing Emperor Titus Mede II during the final Dark Brotherhood quest in Skyrim results in very insignificant changes. Guards will have one or two new dialogues where they express their sorrow for the death of the emperor. Some might even talk about the rise of Dark Brotherhood once again…. That’s pretty much it.</p><h2>Can you still join the Imperials after killing the emperor?</h2><p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition. What happens of i killed the emperor titus mede ii can I still be in the legion? Yes, you can kill the Emperor and still join the legion. Your choices don’t matter because there is no consequence for your choices.</p><h2>What is Orpheus not supposed to do?</h2><p>The voice of Orpheus was so moving that Hades promised to this desperate man that Eurydice would follow him to the Upper World, the world of the living. However, he warned Orpheus that for no reason must he look back while his wife was still in the dark, for that would undo everything he hoped for.</p><h2>What happens if you don’t poison the emperor’s soul?</h2><p>Poison or no poison, you’re going to be forced to kill the emperor. If you use the poison, well he’ll keel over from that. If you elect to not use it, he’ll simply keep eating soup until you decide to kill him. Basically, the end result is the same no matter what.</p><h2>Why did Orpheus fail his quest?</h2><p>Only a few feet away from the exit, Orpheus lost his faith and turned to see Eurydice behind him, sending her back to be trapped in Hades’ reign forever. Orpheus tried to return to the underworld but was unable to, possibly because a person cannot enter the realm of Hades twice while alive.</p><h2>Is Orpheus or the Emperor the good ending?</h2><p>Freeing Orpheus, and then having him become a Mind-flayer to destroy the Netherbrain and then submitting himself to death = the Best “Good” ending. For a few reasons. 2. If betrayed the Emperor immediately shows their true colors, and joins the villains.</p><h2>How do you get Orpheus and Eurydice back together?</h2><p>While even in death they are separated, you can reunite them by completing the side quest, “Musician and Muse.” To access this quest, you’ll first need to pay one Diamond to the House Contractor to release Orpheus from imprisonment, then find Eurydice in Asphodel.</p><h2>How do you bring Orpheus and Eurydice together Hades?</h2><p>There are three total characters that need to have five hearts before Zagreus can begin to free the lovers from being able to see each other. Orpheus, Eurydice, and Nyx need to be given Nectar until they’ve each got five hearts for Zagreus.</p><h2>What does Orpheus do after losing Eurydice?</h2><p>Orpheus joined the expedition of the Argonauts, saving them from the music of the Sirens by playing his own, more powerful music. On his return, he married Eurydice, who was soon killed by a snakebite. Overcome with grief, Orpheus ventured himself to the land of the dead to attempt to bring Eurydice back to life.</p><h2>Can I free Orpheus without the hammer?</h2><p>How To Save Orpheus in Baldur’s Gate 3. The only way to free Orpheus without killing him is by using the Orphic Hammer. Get the Orphic Hammer from Raphael and dialogue with the Emperor, telling him you will free Orpheus.</p><h2>Why did the emperor join the Netherbrain?</h2><p>He wants to survive and be free. Unless the player convinces him to do so, the Emperor doesn’t even try to seize the netherbrain power, when netherbrain is finally defeated. But if the player frees Orpheus, the Emperor becomes the player’s enemy and allies with the netherbrain.</p><h2>Should you save Orpheus bg3?</h2><p>To free or not to free Orpheus? To summarize, players should side with the Emperor if they don’t want to become Mind Flayers, and they should free Orpheus if they don’t mind all the tentacles.</p><h2>Can you sleep with your guardian bg3?</h2><p>By the time you reach Act 3 in Baldur’s Gate 3, you’ll understand the true nature and identity of the Dream Guardian. Despite everything, they are open to romance- if you would allow them to be.</p><h2>Did the emperor save Guilliman?</h2><p>In the book Godblight, Guilliman’s Primarch brother Mortarion pulled him into the Warp to slay him in Nurgle’s garden. But the Emperor was able to heal Guilliman, use him as a vessel to burn down Nurgle’s gardens, and then revive his son fully — which is a power play that we’re not used to seeing from the big guy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWgmrGqrY6sn6itnJl6qnnSopueZaeewal5zqunoZ2lqHqwvoytn55llaK9pr7Oq2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./super-mario-rpg-how-to-do-30-super-jumps-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Super Mario RPG: How To Do 30 Super Jumps?">&larr;
