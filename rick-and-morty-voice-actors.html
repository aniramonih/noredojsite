His mental health problems may have stemmed from spending time discovering, traveling through portals and troubled lifestyles. Moreover, he has a very controversial outlook on the conventional lifestyle. He kept on tagging his grandson Morty in his crazy adventures. In spite of all of these, he has a heart of gold and ends up helping the people whom he cares about.</span></p><p><span>Now, when it comes to Mortimer “Morty” Smith Sr., he is an unlucky grandson who never had the choice but to accompany his grandpa on his expeditions. Morty is a student at Harry Herpson High School. He started as an anxious individual but in no time, he had to face his fears to a part of Rick’s adventures.</span></p><p><span>Apart from being “Rick and Morty’s” voice actor, Roiland has been doing the same for years now.

With her character of Summer, she becomes a part of the comical grandad-grandson’s antics.</span></p><p><span>She is intelligent, have quite similarities with her grandfather and sometimes ends up being jealous of Rick. Originally, she wanted to stay away from the misadventures but since she is just like any typical American teen girl looking for popularity, she chooses to be included in their journey. Besides, she also wishes that her family could become normal.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Sarah Chalke as Beth Smith</h3><p><span>The daughter of Rick and mother to Morty, Beth Smith is a horse surgeon who is the main breadwinner supporting her loved family. She is a talented vet but her insecurities make her feel that she isn’t an actual veterinarian or a “real doctor”. Moreover, her husband does not contribute to the household and she also suffers from huge abandonment issues after her father left her alone for 20 years.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Sarah has previously done comic roles like that in “Roseanne”, “Clone High” and “American Dad”. The Canadian actress is well-respected in the industry.</span></p><h3>Chris Parnell as Jerry Smith</h3><p><span>Rose to fame with his character of Garth Holliday in “<a href=# rel=noopener>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</a>”. Later he entered into the world of voicing with “Archer”, “Gravity Falls”, “Robot Chicken” and more before being a “Rick and Morty” voice actor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Jerry and Beth were high school fling and he got Beth pregnant on the couple’s prom night. After that, they married and had their second child. The couple feels like their teen pregnancy and early marriage have forced them to miss out on many things.</span></p><p><span>They do share a strained relationship and he does not have any career plans. Despite not agreeing on supporting Rick’s antics he doesn’t have much to say about Morty joining his grandfather.</span></p><p><span>Well, these are the main “Rick and Morty” voice actors who have remained in the show since its inception.
