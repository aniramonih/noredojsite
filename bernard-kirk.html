At the start of the third quarter, Kirk ran a kickoff back 80 yards for a touchdown. Syndicated columnist Billy Evans wrote that Kirk's 80-yard run "through the entire Illinois team" was "the most spectacular play performed by a Michigan player this year," and "one of the most brilliant feats of the year." Kirk also recovered a fumbled punt in the second quarter at the Illinois 18-yard-line that led to another Michigan touchdown. Columnist Evans wrote that Kirk was "directly and indirectly responsible" for all 24 points scored by Michigan against Illinois. After the Illinois game, Kirk reportedly left the stadium before the crowd and spent several hours hunting in the woods outside of Ann Arbor.</p><p>At the end of the 1922 season, Kirk was selected as a first-team end on several All-Western and All-American teams. Harold Johnson of the Chicago American wrote that Kirk "stands out" among the ends</p><p>Billy Evans picked Kirk for his 1922 "National Honor Roll," and credited Kirk's performance to physical conditioning</p><p>In the early morning hours of Sunday, December 17, 1922, Kirk sustained a fractured skull and internal injuries in an automobile accident. Kirk and four others were returning to Ann Arbor after a night in Detroit when the car in which Kirk was a passenger slid off the icy road and crashed into a telephone pole. The other four members of the party, including fellow Michigan football player Eddie Usher, were either uninjured or sustained only minor injuries. Kirk was taken to Beyer Memorial Hospital in Ypsilanti unconscious and in critical condition.</p><p>After an up-and-down week, meningitis set in, and Kirk died on Saturday morning, December 23, 1922. On learning of Kirk's passing, Kirk's teammate Harry Kipke told reporters, "Bernie Kirk was one of the best liked boys that ever wore a Michigan uniform. He was one of the greatest ends the University ever had, and he was a real fellow in every respect."</p><p>In 1921, Kirk was a starter at the end position in six of Michigan's seven games. However, he was unable to play in the season's final game against Minnesota due to an ankle injury sustained in the game against Wisconsin. At the end of the 1921 season, Kirk was selected as a first-team end on the All Western football team. He was also the only Michigan player selected as a first-team player on the Harp's All-American Team. Walter Camp picked Kirk for "Honorable Mention" honors on his 1921 All-American team.</p><p>In September 1920, Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne expressed concern when his two Michiganian stars, Gipp and Kirk, failed to report for the team's fall practice. While Gipp returned to South Bend, Kirk transferred to the University of Michigan. Rockne later recalled that Kirk and Gipp had been "practically inseparable" and reflected on his disappointment in losing the talented Kirk. Rockne said of Kirk</p><p>Kirk starred on Michigan's freshman team in 1920, but was ineligible to play on Michigan's varsity team in his first year after transferring.</p><p>Many newspapers noted the coincidence that Kirk and George Gipp, former teammates and close friends, had both died even before all of the All-American teams had been announced (Gipp had died in December 1920). Notre Dame Coach Rockne recalled that Gipp and Kirk had been "great pals" and "practically inseparable." A Wisconsin newspaper made the following observation</p><p>After graduating from high school, Kirk enrolled at the University of Notre Dame. As a sophomore in 1919, he was a starter for the Notre Dame football team coached by the legendary Knute Rockne. He played end for the undefeated 1919 Fighting Irish team that also featured another Michiganian, George Gipp. The passing combination of Gipp at left halfback to Kirk at left end became one of Notre Dame's greatest offensive weapons in 1919. In October 1919, The Fort Wayne News and Sentinel praised "the ability of Kirk in receiving passes and breaking away for long runs." In early November 1919, Kirk drew attention for his work in Notre Dame's win over Indiana. The Indianapolis Star praised the team's end play</p><p>In late November, Notre Dame defeated Purdue 33-13, and the Indiana Star reported that the Boilermakers would have finished on top had it not been for the passing attack of Gipp and Kirk. Kirk scored two touchdowns against Purdue, and the Star noted: "Some of the passes completed by Gipp and Kirk were of the sensational order. Two touchdowns resulted from passes, Gipp to Kirk ..." At the end of the 1919 season, the Indianapolis Sunday Star named Gipp and Kirk to its All-Indiana team, two of the four Notre Dame players to be so honored in 1919. The Star wrote of Kirk</p><p>Kirk was also selected by critics for the All-Western team in 1919.</p><p>Bernard C. Kirk (May 8, 1900 – December 23, 1922) was an American football player who played for Notre Dame in 1919 and for Michigan from 1921 to 1922. He was selected as an All-American at the end position in both 1921 and 1922. In December 1922, shortly after being named an All-American and while at the height of his popularity, Kirk suffered a fractured skull in an automobile accident, and died several days later at a hospital in Ypsilanti, Michigan. His funeral was attended by the Governor of Michigan and many other dignitaries, and was reported in newspapers across the United States.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfl7KzusCrm2ajmae4</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./boris-kodjoe-responds-to-haters-after-wife-nicole-ari-parker-says-she-misses-the-single-life-388766.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Boris Kodjoe Responds To Haters After Wife Nicole Ari Parker Says She Misses The Single Life">&larr;
