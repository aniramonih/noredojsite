Whereas the elder brother enjoys the limelight and is always on the news 24×7, there is hardly any news about his younger brother Robert, who seems to keep a very low profile away from the gaze of media. However, it was not the case earlier, and Robert had a busy social life in New York during the 1980-90s. He organized and participated in grand parties. His wife, Blaine Trump, was known as the society queen. But all this changed, and he became a social recluse after his divorce with his wife of 25 years, Blaine, in 2007.</p><p>Robert has always been considered as a classy and dignified gentleman, unlike his brother Donald. As of now, he has declared that he is gainfully retired. He lives in Millbrook, New York. He has a live-in friend in Ann Marie Pallan, who was his secretary earlier. He is very supportive of his brother and backs every move and decision of the President.</p><p>Maybe you know about Robert Trump very well But do you know how old and tall is he, and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Robert Trump’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Robert Trump is the youngest of all his brothers. His father, Fred Trump, who was born in New York, was one of the biggest real estate developers in New York City. Fred’s father and Robert’s grandfather, Frederick Trump, made a fortune during the Gold Rush.</p><p>With this huge inheritance, Fred Trump made a company and named it after his mother, Elizabeth Trump & Son. Years later, when Donald Trump inherited the family assets and became the Chairman and President, he renamed the company as The Trump Organization. He continued to occupy this position until he became the President of the US.</p><p>Robert Trump was born two years after Donald Trump, who was born on June 14, 1946, in 1948, in the Queens area in New York. Unlike Donald, who enrolled in the New York Military Academy and later studied at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, not much is known about the academic life of Robert Trump. However, one can be certain that his early education must have taken place in a prominent school.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Robert Trump married Blaine Trump, and the marriage lasted a quarter of a century, or, for 25 years. This marriage could have lasted longer, but for Robert having an extra-marital affair with a former business colleague and former secretary Ann Marie Pallan. Robert’s marriage ended in divorce in 2006.</p><p>Robert met Ann while she worked in the Trump family real estate office in Brooklyn. Ann Marie belongs to the family who owns and operates Gurney’s, which is a well-known resort and spa in Montauk, at one end of Long Island.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born in 1948, Robert Trump is 72 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. His height is 1.69 m tall, and his weight is 75 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Robert Trump became a top executive of The Trump Organization, which is the family’s real estate business. He was responsible for the Trump Organization’s real estate holdings outside of Manhattan and New York. Formerly it was named Elizabeth Trump & Son and was later renamed Trump Organization when Donald Trump became the President and Chairman of the company after his father, Fred, died in 1999.</p><p>Robert Trump is 70 years old and has retired from an active role in the office of the Trump Organization. He lives in Millbrook, New York, with his partner Ann Marie Pallan in the $3.7 million houses which he gifted to Ann Marie in 2004, before his divorce.</p><p>After his retirement, Robert indulges in several philanthropic and community service activities. He also acts as an angel investor and mentors to entrepreneurs and not-for-profit organizations in the vicinity. He is also a trustee of the Angels of Light, a non-profit organization that supports and entertains people by providing holidays. He also donates to animals and especially horse rescue operations.</p><h2>Awards & Achievement</h2><p>Robert Trump has not won any significant awards, but he has earned respect as the worthy successor of Fred Trump, who was the famous American billionaire real estate developer and owner.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Robert Trump in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Robert-Trump-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, the net worth of Robert Trump is $220 million. Robert has inherited more than $200 million from the wealth of his deceased father, Fred Trump, who died in 1999.

While Donald is flamboyant and loves to be in the limelight, Robert shies away from the spotlight. He is a very dignified and modest person. Despite these external differences, Robert is a great supporter of his brother Donald Trump. There is no sibling rivalry amongst them. This itself is something worth appreciation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZL%2BwrsSrq2asoqq6sXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kWlpaWViZX9yew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./roger-fisher-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Roger Fisher Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
