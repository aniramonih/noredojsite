Boreing, who serves as COO, is jokingly referred to as the "god-king" of The Daily Wire by staff and fans.</p><p>In 2013, Boreing and <a href=#>Ben Shapiro</a> founded the U.S. media watchdog and activism organization Truth Revolt. The group targeted advertisers of left-wing personalities in a manner consistent with the efforts against the right by the left-wing organization Media Matters for America. Boreing declared Truth Revolt's purpose to be "mutually assured destruction" with the left, suggesting he and Shapiro would shutter Truth Revolt if the left ceased its anti-free speech efforts. Boreing served as Managing Editor of Truth Revolt.</p><p>In early 2010, Boreing formed an independent film studio, Declaration Entertainment, with television editor and screenwriter <a href=#>Bill Whittle</a>. The two met at a luncheon with conservative writer and publisher <a href=#>Andrew Breitbart</a> and together produced some of Whittle's early internet videos. On March 16, 2010, Boreing and Whittle guest hosted for Larry O'Connor's BlogTalkRadio podcast The Stage Right Show. The company used "citizen producers" to finance its film projects. In August 2012, the studio completed filming for its first feature film, The Arroyo, which he directed and co-wrote with John Bickley, which had a limited release in January 2014.</p><p>That same year, he produced Jeff Mizushima's comedy film Etienne!, which won the Jury Awards at the CineVegas and Oxford International Film Festivals, and the western Shadowheart directed by Dean Alioto. He also wrote a second short film, Byron Phillips: Found, in 2009. An outspoken critic of bias in entertainment industry, Boreing was a columnist for Big Hollywood and Newsbusters.org during this time.</p><p>In June 2006, Boreing joined Kurt Schemper, Joel <a href=#>David Moore</a>, and <a href=#>Zachary Levi</a> to form Coattails Entertainment, a film production company. He produced and co-wrote the company's first feature film, Spiral, with Moore who also directed alongside <a href=#>Adam Green</a>. In addition, Boreing had an uncredited role in the film as an extra. The four men (Boreing, Green, Levi, and Moore) were all personal friends and the filming process was described "a movie by committee". Christopher Stipp of Asitecalledfred.com praised the film writing that "the combination of Moore's directing/writing and of Jeremy Boreing's writing with Levi and Amber Tamblyn's performances should prove to be the reason why this movie stands above most of the other independent fare that passes as film". He was later interviewed with Levi, Moore, and lead actress <a href=#>Tricia Helfer</a> on Up Close with <a href=#>Carrie Keagan</a> to promote the film.</p><p>Born in Slaton, Texas, Boreing began his career at a local historic regional theatre, the Garza, as a writer and producer. In 2002, Boreing met future writing partner Joel <a href=#>David Moore</a>, a friend of a friend, who helped move Moore's couch with his pickup truck. Boreing eventually made the move to Los Angeles in the mid-2000s to work as a film producer and screenwriter. His first job in Hollywood was with <a href=#>Zachary Levi</a>, another friend from Lubbock, and <a href=#>Eric McCormack</a> for a television pilot with Michael C. Forman's Big Cattle Productions. Boering subsequently signed with the literary department of the William Morris Agency. He wrote his first short film, Miles from Home, in 2006. A Christian pastor, he established a home church in Los Angeles.</p><p><a href=#>Jeremy Danial Boreing</a> (born February 5, 1979) is an American director, screenwriter, and producer.
