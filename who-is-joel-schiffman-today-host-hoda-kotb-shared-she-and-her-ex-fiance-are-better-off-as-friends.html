Beyond her professional success, Kotb’s personal life has also garnered attention from the viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>For years, her relationship with Schiffman, a successful financier, was a subject of interest and admiration after the couple announced their engagement, which brought joy to many, as the duo embodied love and companionship. They embraced parenthood, adopting daughters Haley Joy and Hope Catherine in 2017 and 2019, respectively. However, as with any love story, theirs also had its twists and turns. On the 'Today' show episode of January 31, 2022, Kotb announced that her engagement with Schiffman has been called off, adding that they have taken the decision to co-parent their two daughters.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>‘She checks up on me’: Issa Rae gets candid about friendship with Beyonce on ‘Today’ with Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Hoda Kotb’s ex-fiance?</h2><p>Born on March 21, 1958, Schiffman is an accomplished financier and entrepreneur. He currently holds the position of Head of Strategic Partnerships at Schroder Investment Management, where he previously served as the Head of Intermediary Distribution for North America from January 2020 to August 2022. Throughout his extensive career, he has worked with prominent financial institutions, including Janus Financial Group, Columbia Management, Kidder Peabody, Smith Barney, Trail Ridge Capital, Lord, Abbett & Co, and Reed, Connor & Birdwell. A distinguished alumnus, Schiffman holds degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>His life took a beautiful turn when he met Kotb at an event for Wall Street professionals in 2013. There were sparks when he bravely approached the 'Today' host, requesting her autograph before she left. Later, through a friend, he inquired about her relationship status and, upon discovering she was single, took the initiative to ask her out via email. In February 2017, the couple's love expanded to include a new member of their family as Kotb announced the adoption of their first daughter, Haley Joy. In April 2019, they embraced parenthood once more by adopting their second daughter, Hope Catherine. Their love story continued to flourish, and on November 25, 2019, Kotb delightedly announced the news of her engagement to Schiffman live on the 'Today' show. The couple initially planned to marry in 2020, but due to the global Covid-19 pandemic, they had to postpone the celebration, cherishing the safety and well-being of their loved ones. However, Kotb announced their decision to part ways in January 2022.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Today's Hoda Kotb's 'cozy' friendship with co-host Jenna Bush Hager labeled 'fake' by body language expert</a></p><h2 class=split>'We’re better as friends'</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Paris Hilton gets candid about her ‘mom era’ on ‘Today’ with Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager after welcoming second baby</a></p><p>In a heartfelt announcement, Kotb disclosed that she and her fiance, Schiffman decided to part ways but will continue to co-parent their two daughters. "Joel and I have had a lot of prayerful and really meaningful conversations over the holidays, and we decided that we're better as friends and parents than we are as an engaged couple," Kotb stated, adding, "So we decided that we are going to start this new year and begin it kind of on our new path as loving parents to our adorable, delightful children, and as friends."</p><p>Despite the difficult decision, Kotb expressed feeling brave in sharing the truth with the public. While the breakup news came as a surprise to many, the host expressed relief in being open about the situation. She looked forward to the future, as the couple planned to remain in touch to be caring parents to their lovely daughters. Kotb praised her ex-fiance, saying, "He’s a great guy, and he’s a very kind and loving person, and I feel privileged to have spent eight years with him. We are both good, and we are both going on our way and our path, and we’ll be good parents to those two lovely kids."</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Jenna Lyons gets candid about possible return to 'RHONY' with 'Today' co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager</a></p><p><a href=#>'Today' host Hoda Kotb reveals her 'secret signal' to daughters during Thanksgiving Day Parade every year</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKOmnqRdqLCptcWfpJqmXam8pa3YZp%2Boq6RitbCwwGaiqKySYsCprdGem2armJp6orrDZp%2Beql2axW6yyJqlnJ1dlr%2BmecGeq62domK8p7KMmqpmnqKesq%2Bw0g%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-pedro-segundo-more-about-promised-land-cast-bellamy-young-husband-and-his-wikipedia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Pedro Segundo?
