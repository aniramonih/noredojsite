Her down-to-earth personality makes everyone like her immediately.</p><p>However, she does not have a boyfriend. It has been a while since she has dated anyone as well.</p><p>This is mainly because she has been in bad relationships and does not want history to return. She is finally ready to start dating and have a boyfriend. But she also has a few criteria the person needs to meet before becoming her boyfriend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Valkyrae on her future boyfriend</h2><p>Valkyrae, whose real name is Rachell Hofstetter, recently appeared as a guest on the 100 Thieves podcast. There, she discussed her dating life, sharing some of the dating expectations and conditions she currently has while seeking a new boyfriend.</p><p>Throughout their interview, she opened up about her dating life, describing how and why she uninstalled all her dating apps. She also discussed her experience as a single woman and what she is searching for in a prospective partner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>She claimed that her standards were at the moment because of her past relationships. She said, “My standards are incredibly high now. I’ve had some really bad relationships before, and I just never want to have to deal with that again.”</p><p>Valkyrae explained that some of her previous relationships failed because of her partner’s fear of her achievements.</p><p>She is one of the most viewed game streamers and influencers with a massive fanbase. As a result, her former boyfriends were insecure about their respective careers.</p><p>She said that a continual comparison was drawn between herself and her boyfriend — which she despised and believed was reductive. The comparison was often about their achievements, and it soon turned toxic.</p><p>Valkyrae explained that, at times, she did not share anything about her career. She did so because she did not want to hurt the feelings of the person she was dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rae.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Valkyrae claimed that she wanted a supportive boyfriend who was secure with his job. (Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>)</p><p>As a result, one of the primary qualities she seeks in a boyfriend is someone who is at ease and secure within themselves. She noted, “I don’t want a partner that’s not okay with their own grind.”</p><p>Valkyrae then emphasized this approach’s importance while looking for a new partner. She said she did not care what her future partner’s job could be.</p><p>All she asked was that they were secure with their jobs and supportive of hers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Valkyrae’s ex-boyfriend</h2><p>Valkyrae’s last known relationship was with her ex-boyfriend, Michael “Sonii” Sherman. They were friends before they started dating.</p><p>The pair dated from 2016 to 2021 — parting ways after four years of relationship. Their abrupt split led fans to speculate a lot about their relationship.</p><p>While Valkyrae was talking about her abusive former boyfriend, her fans misunderstood and thought she was talking about Sherman. However, she clarified and <a href=# rel=noopener>defended Sherman</a>, claiming to be still in love with him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She stated that he had never done anything wrong to her and was not the person she was referring to.</p><p>She went on to say that what happened with Sherman was more like unfortunate timing, different routes, and different priorities. She reminded her fans that he was a beautiful person and an excellent guy.&nbsp;</p><p>The streamer mentioned how they were sometimes different regarding priorities and pathways. She confessed that there were moments when she was simply too busy for relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>The two previously fueled patch-up rumors after a group photo of the two circulated on social media. These rumors, however, quickly died away.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Teenage Rapper Lil Purk to Serve 20 Years in Prison for Atlantic Station Double Murder</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Lil Purk has been jailed 20 years in prison.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lil-Purk-Arrested.jpg alt="Teenage Rapper Lil Purk to Serve 20 Years in Prison for Atlantic Station Double Murder" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Teenage Rapper Lil Purk, real name Antonio Jackson, has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">jailed</a> for 20 years in prison for a deadly shooting near Atlantic Station in November 2022.</p><p>Five of the six defendants, Lil Purk, Demetrius Hill, Toney Wilson, Deandre Forston, and DeRodney Russell, entered negotiated guilty pleas, their sentences ranging from 20 to 40 years.&nbsp;</p><p>The rapper was sentenced to 20 years, with 10 years to be served in custody and 10 years on probation.

I called the police office almost 30 times in the last two years, and they told me they can’t do nothing. I said he’s out and breaking into these folks’ cars, can you please get him off the street.”</p><p>On the other hand, Cameron’s family remembered him as a teenager with a passion for science, animals, cooking, and dirt bike riding. He had also been practicing boxing since the age of nine.&nbsp;</p><p>Cameron’s mother, Tiffany Smith said, “Cameron has been a boxer since 9-years-old, and he was heading for a professional boxing career. He trained five days a week with a pro boxing coach.”</p><p>Additionally, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>11Alive News</a>, the shootout occurred on the 17th Street Bridge originated from two groups initially escorted off the Atlantic Station property due to unruly behavior and curfew violations.</p><p>Atlanta Police later confirmed their belief that the shooting was gang-related.

During this time, she began conceptualizing music videos for existing songs and discovered her passion for editing homemade videos.&nbsp;</p><p>The newfound interest propelled her towards film school, and eventually, a return to music was sparked by a significant breakup at the age of 23, inspiring her to create her first song.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Describing her early musical endeavors as a process of “catching up,” the artist filled in the gaps from the years she spent immersed in film and other pursuits.</p><p>Her musical career took a significant turn with the release of her ‘Out of Orbit’ EP in 2022.
