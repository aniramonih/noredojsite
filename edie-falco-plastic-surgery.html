The actress who is 59 looks like she could be half her age because she has no wrinkles, lines, creases, or sagging skin to show for her age. Fans suspect Edie Falco has had Botox, a facelift, and breast augmentation but she has never responded to these plastic surgery speculations.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Edie Falco</strong> is an American <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>actress</strong></a> who is best known for portraying the character of Carmela Soprano on the HBO series The Sopranos and playing the role of Nurse Jackie Peyton on the Showtime series Nurse Jackie. People might also recognize her from when she portrayed Diane Whittlesey in HBO's prison drama Oz.</p><p>Other notable works she has done on series were in 2016 when she played Sylvia Wittel on the web series Horace and Pete and in 2017 when she portrayed the character of Leslie Abramson in the first season of the true crime anthology series Law & Order True Crime.</p><p>The actress has also done several movies and some of her movie credits include lead roles in Laws of Gravity and Judy Berlin, and supporting roles in Sunshine State, Freedomland, and The Comedian. She was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead for her performance in the former.</p><p>She has also done Broadway and she has even earned a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance in the 2011 Broadway revival of the House of Blue Leaves.&nbsp;She has won two Golden Globe awards (from eleven nominations) and four Emmy awards (from fourteen nominations), all for individual performances.</p><p>After the years she has spent in the film industry, she was bound to be the subject of plastic surgery speculations. Because she did not age as faster as people would have liked to see, she was believed to have taken the aid of Botox and a facelift. Some also think she's got breast augmentation. Let's learn more about Edie Falco's plastic surgery!</p><p>There are more interesting <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>plastic surgery</a></strong> stories of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Gil Birmingham</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Cindy Crawford</strong></a> you might want to read.</p><h2>Edie Falco's Plastic Surgery: The Actress Could Be Someone Half Her Age!</h2><p><strong>Edie Falco</strong> has become the new subject of plastic surgery speculations following the release of Avatar: The Way of Water in theaters. She is believed to have undergone <strong>Botox</strong> and a <strong>facelift</strong> which are both anti-aging procedures because apparently, she does not look as old as she should at her age. She's 59.</p><p>It was one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>more delightful surprises</a> in Avatar: The Way of Water when Edie Falco pops up on the screen as General Frances Ardmore, a new military commander on Pandora. The character is aware that Earth is dying and the human population is going to require a new permanent home so, she is on a mission to make Pandora more hospitable for the human race.</p><p>Edie Falco's character is one of the few characters in the sequel who looks like herself because she is human in the movie. She is not blue and very tall like she wishes. She only looks like the human she is playing because well, she is one. People didn't fail to notice her as she was in a human avatar that she looked exceptionally young for someone her age. She's entering her sixties now. And looks like she is half her age which has sparked plastic surgery speculations.</p><p>There are hardly any lines on her face and her forehead. That's not normal for someone who is 59. Edie Falco could easily be someone half her age. Anyone who doesn't know how old she is would be surprised to find out that she is 59 and not in her thirties. It's just not possible even with the best skincare, diet, and workout regime. So, this is the case of plastic surgery, right?</p><p>It has to be because the Sopranos actress didn't always look like she is in her 30s except when she was in her thirties. There was a time when she was aging like she was supposed to. And she had wrinkles on her face, lines on her forehead, and creases around her eyes like a normal aging person. Her skin was also sagging. She looked fine even then. Maybe not fresh and young but still fine. But she clearly didn't like the way she looked or she wouldn't have gotten plastic surgery.</p><p>Edie Falco is now virtually wrinkle-free, she has few negligible lines on her face and that's it. It must be because of Botox. It may not technically count as plastic surgery but it is an anti-aging procedure. The anti-wrinkle injection is why she looks like she has forgotten to age. Because we have seen her before pictures, it's more like she's reversed her aging.</p><p>Besides Botox, Edie Falco is also suspected to have undergone a facelift because her skin has stopped sagging. Botox can fix wrinkles and lines problems but what about the drooping down of cheeks as they age? Her skin is much tighter and smoother now and hence, more youthful. This could only be because of plastic surgery, a facelift to be specific.</p><p>Edie Falco is also believed to have undergone a breast augmentation procedure. In the photos from her past, she used to have much smaller breasts. Quite simply, she was flat-chested before whereas now, that isn't the case. She must have had breast implants because the growth in her chest is certainly not natural. She has a much bigger and rounder chest than before and it's possible only due to plastic surgery.</p><p>These all are just pure speculations on the fans' part because the actress herself has never responded to any plastic surgery rumors about herself. She has not opened her mouth to confirm or deny them.</p><p><strong>Can we interest you in&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;with more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGicnaGVYrOiuMKoZKmkkajBqq%2BMrKyrn5WnxnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./autographed-donald-trump-items-offered-campaign-website-done-autopen-machine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Donald Trump Offers Items On His Campaign Website Signed By An Autopen Machine">&larr;
