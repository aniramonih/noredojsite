She joined the RHOA as a friend of Nene Leakes in Season 10 before getting promoting to a full-time cast member in 2018. And although Eva shares two son with her current husband, Michael Sterling, fans seem most interested in the beef she has with her ex, Kevin McCall ‚Äî and the father of her daughter.</p><p>Let's take a closer look.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Eva has opened up about being a victim of domestic violence.</h2><p>During the most recent <a href=#>Real Housewives of Atlanta</a> reunion, Eva Marcille got super emotional about her former relationship with ex and baby daddy Kevin McCall. Eva opened up about their abusive relationship, and how badly he treated her.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it's a sensitive topic for Eva, some fans are feeling iffy (and confused) about one statement she made about Kevin, and that was <a href=#>calling him a "donor."</a></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait wait wait so Eva Marcille bd she refers to as the ‚ÄúDonor‚Äù is actually Kevin Mcall ?! <a href=#>#RHOA</a></p>‚Äî playboy laflare (@_laflare1017) <a href=#>April 13, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Some are comparing Eva calling Kevin a "donor" to Drake calling his baby mama a "fluke." But after learning about what happened between Eva and Kevin, you might not feel the same way.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Referencing Sophie Brussaux, the mother of Drake's 2-year-old son Adonis, he rapped: ‚ÄúBaby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is.‚Äù</p><p>Many people seem to be upset about this but question.

Eva and Kevin were dating in 2014 when they had Marley, but broke up that spring. Eva began seeing lawyer Michael Sterling and the two got married in 2017. Eva had Marley's last name changed to Sterling.</p><p>Eva has made it very clear that she's not interested in co-parenting with Kevin, whom she wants nothing to do with. She previously stated, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">There's no co-parenting</a>. I'm the parent. He's not in my life, and he's not in Marley's life. I have full custody. Michael is Marley's father. [Kevin] ain't nothing but a memory."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Eva has been very candid about the abuse she faced from Kevin. In 2019, she went on The Rickey Smiley Show and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opened up about her horrifying experience</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"It took me a lot of time to even be able to get up the courage to talk about it because it's embarrassing. Coming from where I come from and being as astute and courageous as I am, you always feel like, 'it can never be me,'" she said.</p><p>She continued, saying that she barely even got to know Kevin. "It wasn't a relationship that lasted long enough for me to even know him," Eva said.</p><p>Eva knew it was time to end the relationship once and for all after Kevin continued to abuse her after she gave birth to Marley. "[The abuse] didn't start for me until I was pregnant with Marley. And then about a month after having Marley, it didn't stop; it got worse. And it got worse with her," she said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Shortly before the interview, Kevin was arrested and charged with domestic violence. He was released from jail after posting a $75,000 bond. Since then, things have been pretty ugly between Eva and Kevin, with Eva having full custody over Marley. Kevin even filed a lawsuit against Eva so that he could spend more time with Marley. Things had gotten so bad, that Eva says she had to involve the FBI at one point.&nbsp;</p><p>She also lives in several houses so that it's harder for Kevin to find her and Marley. "Every time I move, he finds me. Because of that, I live in multiple places. Safety is a priority for me," Eva said.</p><p>After losing the custody battle, Kevin took to social media to make fun of Eva. To this day, he's also denied hurting Eva. In January 2020, Kevin posted an Instagram Story, writing, "What do u get when u cross the term 'police' with say, a random WORD like ‚Äî let's say 'escort' just randomly. Answer: PIG-FORD (Yeah I just for idea from the swipe left freestyle just for the F of it. You smart dummy." (Eva's real last name is Pigford.)&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Kevin had been acting pretty strangely after losing the custody battle with Eva. It seemed like a no-brainer that Eva would get full custody, considering Kevin have been previously arrested after getting into a fight with police officers (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this happened November 2019</a>). He has a felony charge and might even get five years in prison.</p><p>Last March 2019, Kevin vented on Twitter that he thought Eva was using his name for attention, saying, "It's sad when she gotta keep using my name for her story line, if I was the husband I would be like 'Real hoe of Atlanta' is you out of you mind, or is you still obsessed with your child's Father? Why is he in our story line so much ain't I enuff headline for our relationship?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It‚Äôs sad when she gotta keep using my name for her story line, if I was the husband I would be like ‚ÄúReal hoe of Atlanta is you out your mind, or is you still obsessed with your child‚Äôs Father?

"Trust me I‚Äôm not perfect I had anger issues! I‚Äôve completed Anger management to deal with being alienating my children & how to stop playing the victim so that i can control my situation and the overall outcome. My entire Family misses the girls (have Empathy for them at-least)," he tweeted.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trust me I‚Äôm not perfect I had anger issues!

While we get that people may be raising their eyebrows whenever she calls Kevin her "donor," it's also understandable that she's still dealing with her traumatic past.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, call the</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>National Domestic Violence Hotline</strong></a> <strong>at 1‚àí800‚àí799‚àí7233.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmsOiecyaqZyhnKGybq7Am7BmnpGptaa%2B</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./isiah-maxwell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Isiah Maxwell net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
