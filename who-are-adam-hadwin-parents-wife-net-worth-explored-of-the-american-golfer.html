He has won one time on the PGA Tour, two times on the Web.com Tour, and the Canadian Tour.</p><p>Hadwin actually grew up playing golf at Ledgeview Golf Club in British Columbia; another team player was another top young player, Nick Taylor.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Who Are Adam Hadwin Parents?">Who Are Adam Hadwin Parents?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Who Is Adam Hadwin Wife?">Who Is Adam Hadwin Wife?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Adam Hadwin Net Worth Revealed">Adam Hadwin Net Worth Revealed</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Meet Adam Hadwin On Instagram">Meet Adam Hadwin On Instagram</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-adam-hadwin-parents></span>Who Are Adam Hadwin Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adam Hadwin’s parents’ names are Gerry Hadwin and Brenda Hadwin. His father is also a golfer who joined the Canadian PGA in 1979.</p><p>Hadwin was a member of the 2008 RCGA group of Canadian amateur men. He studied at the University of Louisville with a golf scholarship, studied business, and earned the All-America Honorable Mention in 2009.</p><p>Brenda spent a scary Sunday walking around the Abbotsford family home, Adam’s mother. Going back to his amateur days, she could not just watch her son compete. They both could not be too proud of their son, who won the Valspar tournament in Florida for his first PGA TOUR win.</p><p>Brenda turned on her TV in time to see the end. Brenda did not even follow the points online. While Hadwin’s mother avoided TV, his father Gerry was attached to it. Gerry, director of golf at Ledgeview Golf Club in Abbotsford, didn’t miss a single moment.</p><p>He became a professional just after graduating from college. His first professional win was at the Ledgeview Open on the Vancouver Golf Tour, as he went on to win a total of the four VGT events in 2009 too.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-adam-hadwin-wife></span>Who Is Adam Hadwin Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adam Hadwin married his wife, Jessica Dawn Kippenberger, in 2017. The couple faced many challenges, including two failed pregnancies, in their quest for the family.</p><p>With the help of in vitro fertilization, Maddox arrived on January 8, 2020. The struggle they endured and being financially viable using IVF made Hadwin think about helping others facing similar type of challenges and last year, they started the Hadwin Family Foundation.</p><p>Jessica is a Nurse and Health Doctor who is also a wife and mother. She has been listed as the co-Founder of @hadwinfamilyfoundation on her Instagram account.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=adam-hadwin-net-worth-revealed></span>Adam Hadwin Net Worth Revealed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adam Hadwin’s net worth is estimated at around 13 million dollars. He became a Pro in 2009 and has played golf professionally for 13 years as it is his primary source of income.</p><p>However, the numbers mentioned above are just an assumption through online sources. In 2022, Hadwin earned over $200k so far as his best year was 2016-17, where he earned over $3 million.</p><p>The average golfer earns more than $2 million a year as a competitor and will have the opportunity to make at least a span from the course. Adam averages over $1 million prize money per year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-adam-hadwin-on-instagram></span>Meet Adam Hadwin On Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adam Hadwin can be found on Instagram under @ahadwingolf with over 14k followers.
