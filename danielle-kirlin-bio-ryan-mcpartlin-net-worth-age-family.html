If not, and if you are thinking of getting into the holiday spirit, you may certainly add the hallmark genre film to your list of 2021’s holiday movies. In the meantime, let us tell its fans who their favorite man in the show is married to in real life. As it happens, actor Ryan McPartlin who plays Coop&nbsp;The Holiday Fix Up is taken for good as he is happily married to his wife Danielle Kirlin.</p><h3><strong>Meet Danielle Kirlin, Ryan McPartlin Wife</strong></h3><p>Ryan’s wife Danielle also goes around as Danielle Kirlin McPartlin.</p><p>The couple has been married for more than two decades. They met in 1998 when a friend set them up and took some four years to get to know each other before finally tying the knot in 2002.</p><p>He is kenned mostly for his roles in Chuck (2007), L.A.’s Finest (2019), and Hunter Killer (2018).</p><p>Before he moved to Southern California to pursue acting, he got his Speech Communication degree from the University of Illinois; where he also played football in the Big Ten Conference.</p><p>Ryan is also a board-certified personal trainer. And he is also passionate about scuba diving, tennis, snowboarding, racquetball, and some more outdoor activities.</p><h3><strong>Danielle Kirlin And Ryan McPartlin’s Wedding</strong></h3><p>It was the 26th of October that year when Danielle and Ryan exchanged their wedding vows in front of a good amount of friends and family in Quincy, Illinois.</p><p>So, as they celebrated their 19th anniversary in 2021, Ryan took a series of good/old memories from their wedding day. Dedicating to “the best person in the world” he shared how a couple-kids from Illinois, flying by the seat of their pants in California have been now raising two young men, while also running a business and making some television.</p><p>By business, Ryan meant their Plate Therapy; which is a food delivery service providing fresh, organic, chef-crafted ready-to-eat meals to help customers make a real, healthy change in the body. Together the couple has been operating the business since 2015. Also, their ‘story’ on platetherapy.com reveals that they founded the company after Danielle suffered from a thyroid disorder and went through constant fatigue and weight struggles.</p><p>Ryan, co-Founder, and chief taste tester, also wanted his wife’s “healthful-eating mind/body/soul transformation”. Because, before that, he had been also always looking for the best and most healthy way to look his best on and off-screen.</p><p>Now, let us tell you, Danielle and Ryan have two sons, Wyatt Duke McPartlin and Dylan James McPartlin. Wyatt, the eldest one, was 14-years-old and the youngest Dylan James was 11-years-old, as of December 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/danielle-kirlin-bio-ryan-mcpartlin-net-worth-age-family-2021-300x191.jpg><p>A look into Daniell and Ryan’s Instagram tells us that they are one happy bunch always spending time together be it on Valentine’s Day or Christmas.</p><h3><strong>Danielle Kirlin Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 1975, Danielle Kirlin should have reached the age of 46 in 2021. Because it is on the 15th November that she celebrates her birthday.</p><p>She was likely born and bred in her hometown of Quincy, Illinois before she moved to&nbsp;Santa Clarita, California for good.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Danielle Kirlin Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Working full-time as a chief executive officer and founder at Plate Therapy Danielle Kirlin managed to bring in nearly $1 million as net worth into the family (in 2021).</p><p>So you know, as of the time of this writing, Danielle and her team charged $53.00 a day, $57.00 a day, and $59.00/$63.00 for their respective 3 meal plans.</p><p>(Of course) Danielle also has an IMDB profile where they credit her as&nbsp;an actress, known for Centipede! (2004) and Felicity (1998). She is seen playing Zoe in the movie Centipede and she appeared in an episode of Felicity, a series, as a flight attendant.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Ryan McPartlin Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>46 in 2021, Ryan McPartlin celebrates his birthday every year on the 3rd of July.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Tall Is Ryan McPartlin?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ryan McPartlin stands 6′ 4½” (1.94 meters) tall.
