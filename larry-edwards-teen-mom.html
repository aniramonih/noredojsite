When Maci was first pregnant with their son, Bentley (who's now 12, yes we all feel old) Ryan would constantly abandon Maci to go party with friends, and was even emotionally and verbally abusive. It was no surprise when they split, although they did try to co-parent Bentley for his sake.</p><p>Maci ended up marrying her boyfriend Taylor and Ryan married his girlfriend Mackenzie, but they're still very much involved in each other's lives, considering they share a child. And unfortunately, their public interactions are not super civil. Most recently, Maci and Taylor got into a fight with Ryan's parents, Larry and Jen Edwards during a reunion taping. Larry essentially claimed that Maci keeps putting Ryan down even though he's worked really hard on his sobriety.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span><p>Ryan and Mackenzie in 2017</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Larry Edwards say to the tabloids?</h2><p>Larry <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told The Sun</a>, "Ryan is so calm, even at the reunion," adding, "We can’t win, just keep kicking the dog eventually he will bite you and when he does you want to put him down." A <a href=# rel=nofollow>source told The Ashley's Reality Roundup</a> that things got really heated on stage during the reunion, as it was clear Maci was upset, but not saying why. Taylor finally "exploded" and told Larry and Jen how terrible Ryan is, and that he's a better father to Bentley than Ryan.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“He told them Ryan is a ‘piece of s**t’ and that he, unlike Ryan, has been there for Bentley for a long time. He told Larry and Jen that Ryan should be more like he is," the source said. They added, “[Taylor] kind of got up and eventually asked Larry if he wanted to take things outside." Luckily, things didn't continue to escalate. "It didn’t get that far, though. Nothing got physical," the source said. Maci allegedly also called Jen a "manipulative b**ch."</p><p>All of this comes after Ryan and Mackenzie recently called out Maci for keeping Bentley from seeing his dad. However, according to Maci, Bentley will only see Ryan if he agrees to go to therapy with him. "Bentley has set clear boundaries that he doesn't want to be around his dad until they go to therapy together," Maci said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What to know about Larry Edwards from 'Teen Mom'</h2><p>Ryan Edwards dad, Larry Edwards, has been super supportive of his son as he battled his addiction to heroin (Ryan's last stay at rehab was in 2018). The 60-year-old is married to Jen Edwards, and the two come as a united front. Even in earlier episodes of Teen Mom, Larry and Jen were arguably pretty lenient on Ryan, who fans collectively hated because of how badly he treated Maci. They both continue to defend Ryan, especially amidst rumors that their son has relapsed.</p><p>"[Ryan] is doing just fine. Do you think if anything had or would happen they wouldn’t have already exposed it?" Larry told The Sun.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Maci's relationship with Jen and Larry wasn't always like this, though. Even though fans thought Ryan to be unfair to Maci, his parents and Maci were close, and they did their best to make up for Ryan's shortcomings. Maci even invited Jen and Larry to her and Taylor's wedding in 2016. However, it seems like their relationship took a turn at some point, and neither Ryan's parents or Maci have a problem being vocal about it.</p><p>Watch Teen Mom OG on MTV every Tuesday at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa6zvthmnJ2vkaextHnTnpynZZ2kug%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sandra-bullock-keanu-reeves-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sandra Bullock Revealed the Reason She &amp;amp; Keanu Reeves Never Dated  Best Life">&larr;
