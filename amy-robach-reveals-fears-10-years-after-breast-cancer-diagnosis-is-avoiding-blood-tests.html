"If it was to come back in the places you don't want it to…a blood test that shows a marker means you would be facing terminal cancer, <strong>and the fear of that leaves you in the mindset of 'I would rather not know'."&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb0a061ab9bc-amy-robach-tj-holmes-getting-subway.jpg><p id=ej4ss9ozbL data-wc=25>TJ, however, then shared his own perspective, admitting that it "bothers him" that Amy, and many other women, are afraid to go see their doctors.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYJmZXEHVl data-wc=79>"It bothers me and scares me that we have gone through a decade together as friends – you've saved my life in a lot of ways – and then all we've been through to get to this point," he revealed, "and I have to pause because all I am hearing is [that] this women, who I have been through all this with, isn't doing all she can to make sure we have as much time together as we can."&nbsp;</p><p id=eo07y2smXS data-wc=38>"<strong>And this is your body, your struggle, but I feel bad and selfish </strong>for having that thought," he continued, to which Amy responded that she knew her parents would feel the same way and it was not selfish.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0ecb9a4970ac-snapinstaapp2858228761499638842561795027459653715137157n1080.jpg><p id=eOO2Iz9mIV data-wc=59>The pair were also joined by Dr. Elizabeth Comen, who spoke about the gender gap when it comes to healthcare, and why women are not treated the same as men. Dr Comen also cleared up Amy's fears, sharing that not all tumor markers that appear in blood work are "necessarily cancer, as lots of other things can elevate them".</p><p id=eCCLzkxIcF data-wc=11>Listen to the full podcast for more on this topic <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="GMA's Amy Robach inundated with support as she shares hospital photo amid health milestone" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c47f0504735e-amy-robach-glitter.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="GMA's Amy Robach inundated with support as she shares hospital photo amid health milestone" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>GMA's Amy Robach inundated with support as she shares hospital photo amid health milestone</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e0HtxljCr1 data-wc=65>Amy battled breast cancer in 2013, and has been helping to raise awareness and funds for the disease ever since.
