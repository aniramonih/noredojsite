In 2018, Rabe starred in Lucy Kirkwood's play The Children at the Melbourne Theatre Company.</p><p>In 2017, Rabe played the role of Maude in the 6-part TV series Fucking Adelaide, which premiered at the Adelaide Film Festival in October 2017.</p><p>In September 2013 it was announced that Rabe would be cast in the Australian prison drama series, Wentworth, a reimagining of the classic Network Ten soap opera Prisoner. She joined Wentworth in Season Two as sadistic prison governor Joan "The Freak" Ferguson, a role originally played by <a href=#>Maggie Kirkpatrick</a> in Prisoner. Rabe as Ferguson is seen as intimidating and evil and often uses a clever, non-physical approach in a way to control and manipulate the prisoners and officers alike, with little need for violence, unlike Kirkpatrick's character, who mainly resorted to violence. Rabe appeared in both Season Two and Season Three in a leading role, as it was finally discovered that Ferguson is unstable and her crimes are revealed. Rabe returned as Ferguson in the fourth season in 2016, in which she becomes a prisoner at Wentworth and uses strategies to get herself out of prison for good. Rabe reprised her role for the fifth season of Wentworth in 2017, in which Ferguson remains incarcerated for killing inmate Bea Smith (Danielle Cormack) at the end of the previous season. At the end of the fifth season, Ferguson was buried alive and her fate was left unknown. It was previously unknown if Rabe would reprise her role as Joan Ferguson for the sixth season; however, she began appearing from episode seven of the twelve-part season, as a figment of character Will Jackson's imagination. Although the character was presumed dead, it is finally revealed in the season seven finale that she is alive and will return for the eighth season in 2020.</p><p>In 2012 Rabe received a Helpmann Award for Best Female Actor in a Musical for her performance in Grey Gardens for The Production Company.
