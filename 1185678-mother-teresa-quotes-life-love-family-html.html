I will never understand all the good that a simple smile can accomplish.Life is a song, sing it. Life is a struggle, accept it.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f77142e2a0ad4a03.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Memorable Ram Dass quotes on love, death, fear, aging, and healing</span></p></a>There is no key to happiness; the door is always open.Smile at each other. Smile at your wife, smile at your husband, smile at your children, smile at each other – it doesn’t matter who it is – and that will help to grow up in greater love for each other.Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do…but how much love we put in that action.Life is an opportunity, benefit from it. Life is beauty, admire it. Life is a dream, realize it.Life is love, enjoy it. Life is mystery, know it. Life is a promise, fulfill it.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f77142e2a0ad4a03.png><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Wisdom quotes from the Bible</p>There are many people who can do big things, but there are very few people who will do the small things.Jesus said love one another. He didn’t say love the whole world.Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/235ba67697918c2e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best quotes about helping others that will tug at your compassion</span></p></a>Be happy in the moment, that’s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more.Nothing makes you happier than when you really reach out in mercy to someone who is badly hurt.Do not worry about why problems exist in the world – just respond to people’s needs.Without patience, we will learn less in life. We will see less. We will feel less. We will hear less. Ironically, rush and more usually mean less.The fruit of love is service, which is compassion in action.It is easy to love the people far away. It is not always easy to love those close to us. Bring love into your home, for this is where our love for each other must start.Together we can do great things.If you find happiness, people may be jealous. Be happy anyway.Love is a fruit in season at all times, and within reach of every hand.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cd28a2e54dcdf6a1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 lovely flower quotes to brighten up your mood for spring</span></p></a>Never be so busy as not to think of others.The child is the beauty of God present in the world, that greatest gift to a family.Life is a game, play it… Life is too precious, do not destroy it.Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gift to that person, a beautiful thing.Do you want to do something beautiful for God? There is a person who needs you. This is your chance.We must make our homes centers of compassion and forgive endlessly.The more you have, the more you are occupied, the less you give. But the less you have the more free you are. Poverty for us is a freedom. It is not mortification, a penance. It is joyful freedom. There is no television here, no this, no that. But we are perfectly happy.We have not come into the world to be numbered; we have been created for a purpose; for great things: to love and be loved.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7034938673908e99.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Mary Oliver quotes that will change your worldview</span></p></a>Life is an adventure, dare it.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Bible verses on prosperity and wealth</p>If we pray, we will believe; If we believe, we will love; If we love, we will serve. Loneliness and the feeling of being unwanted is the most terrible poverty.Whatever you do for your family, your children, your husband, your wife, you do for God. All we do, our prayers, our work, our suffering, is for Jesus. People are generally irrational, unreasonable and selfish. They deserve to be loved, anyway. I never look at the masses as my responsibility. I look at the individual. I can love only one person at a time. I can feed only one person at a time. Just one, one, one. You are greater than you know. God doesn’t require us to succeed, he only requires that you try. God has created us to love and to be loved, and this is the beginning of prayer-to know that He loves me, that I have been created for greater things.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/651120d3328bde87.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brene Brown quotes that address love, vulnerability and shame</span></p></a>Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin. Be kind to each other. It is better to commit faults with gentleness than to work miracles with unkindness.If you want to bring happiness to the whole world, go home and love your family.The problem with our world is that we draw the circle of family too small. There is a light in this world, a healing spirit more powerful than any darkness we may encounter. It is not how much we do, but how much love we put in the doing. It is not how much we give, but how much love we put in the giving. Do ordinary things with extraordinary love.Love begins by taking care of the closest ones – the ones at home. Whenever you share love with others, you’ll notice the peace that comes to you and to them.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/45aeed3ecede9441.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Thich Nhat Hanh quotes that will inspire you</span></p></a>If we really want to love we must learn how to forgive.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytt64n4290ejg.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Prayer points for family with Bible verses</p>Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless. Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. I have found the paradox, that if you love until it hurts, there can be no more hurt, only more love. God does not create poverty; we do, because we do not share. We must not be surprised when we hear of murders, killings, of wars, or of hatred… If a mother can kill her own child, what is left but for us to kill each other? We think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry, naked and homeless. The poverty of being unwanted, unloved and uncared for is the greatest poverty. We must start in our own homes to remedy this kind of poverty.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/de7c10481a668824.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Fight Club quotes that will blow your mind</span></p></a>I don’t do great things. I do small things with great love.The miracle is not that we do this work, but that we are happy to do it.If you are kind, people may accuse you of ulterior motives.
