Garcia's handle for his account, which has since been deleted, was "Psychovision," which he also used for his profile on the OK.RU website.</p><p>Garcia's photo next to a waiter in Texas Twin Peaks, which was posted to the account, was also verified. Eight persons were killed and seven others were injured in the three to four-minute-long shooting. The deceased have been named as Christian LaCour, 20, , 26, Kyu Song-cho, 37, Cindy Cho, 35, James Cho, 3, and 32-year-old Elio Cumana-Rivas. , 45, is the ninth victim of the shooting at Allen Mall.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><h2 class=split>What did Mauricio Garcia do in the video?</h2><p dir=ltr lang=en>Video of the Allen, Texas mass shooter Mauricio Garcia wearing a ghost face mask and using a voice changer</p>â€” That Guy Shane (@ProfanityNewz) <a href=#>May 9, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>Garcia smiled in the horrifying footage as he yanked off his mask and said, "Not quite what you were expecting, huh? Go watch the video, cya." Garcia's video looks to have been shot in an apartment; a poster for Evanescence and Snoopy can be seen in the backdrop. He is barely seen on the video for about 23 seconds before he covers the camera lens and starts playing music over a smiley face that appears to have been created to look like Hitler.</p><h2 class=split>'Face reveal'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/36ba81f5-f9e8-4541-bd34-10f662e54d10.png><p>The "face reveal" video was uploaded prior to the shooting but was intended to be released following the heinous act. According to Bellingcat researcher Aric Toler, it happened after his account published images of Nazis, weapons, and ammo as well as extreme rants on Jews, women, and racial minorities. He posted more than a dozen images of the retail mall and its surroundings just three weeks before he committed the horrific shooting, along with screenshots of Google location data recording peak visitor hours. According to Toler and NBC, Garcia, who was shot and killed there, had an account on the Russian website OK.RU. Garcia posted a picture of himself next to a Hooters waitress in a Texas location on a Russian social media account. "Me at the Twin Peaks in Frisco on Preston Road," the text that accompanied the photo read. "Now that's a girl who knows how to make a guy smile. How to drive a guy crazy," as verified by.</p><h2 class=split>'Live everyday like itâ€™s ur last'</h2><p>After an Indian victim, Aishwarya Thatikonda was identified, the mass shooting at the Allen Premium Outlets shook Texas and the other side of the world. Social media users are paying tribute to the victims in a Twitter thread devoted to them. A concerned user tweeted for Aishwarya saying, "India should issue a travel advisory for it's citizens against the US, tagging em for being an out of control gun state n also notify it's citizens overseas concerning the matter." Another user said, "Tragic and heartbreaking." Someone wrote a positive message along with the tribute, "Hugely tragic for all the families who lost a loved one & for that matter even those who got injured. Life is so unpredictable letâ€™s all try to be the best we can." "This thread made me sick to my stomach. May their souls be at peace," mentioned another. A user claimed to have asked one of the victims where the restrooms were when visiting the mall. He wrote, "I canâ€™t believe this."
