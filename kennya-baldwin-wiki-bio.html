Kennya is best known for her marriage to Stephen Baldwin, but that is not her only claim to fame. Kennya is also the mother of Alaia Baldwin and Hailey Rhode Bieber, the latter of whom tied the knot to Justin Bieber. Given the number of celebrities around her and the fact that the Baldwins are one of the well-recognized families in Hollywood, it is almost impressive that Kennya has managed to enjoy her life on her terms. So, for this article, we will take a closer look at the secretive life of Kennya Baldwin.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Kennya Deodato was born in 1968 in Brazil. Born to Eumir Deodato and Mary Ellen Deodato, Kennya was raised in a musical household. Her father, Eumir is a renowned composer and pianist who won a Grammy for his contribution to music. Inspired by her father, Kennya always wanted to make a name for herself in the world of music. But the reality was harsh for her and Kennya decided to go down a different path. As for academics, Kenny enrolled at York Preparatory School in New York and graduated in 1986. She later enrolled at Parsons School of Design and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1989.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stephen-baldwin-wife-kennya-baldwin.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>Kennya started working as a graphic designer after her graduation in 1989. Not enough is known about her career to create a concrete timeline. She has worked as a graphic designer for all her life but given the success of her husband and daughters, it is not known if she has carried her career to her later years.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life:</h2><p>Kennya Baldwin is happily married to Stephen Baldwin and the pair have been together forever. The pair first met at a subway in 1987 and began dating soon after. The pair dated for three years before tying the knot on the 10th of June, 1990. At the time, Stephen Baldwin was recognized for his role in the TV series, The Young Riders, and was reaching new levels of fame. While Stephen reportedly battled drug and alcohol addiction at the time, he was clean by the time he married Kennya. Following their marriage, Kennya accompanied Baldwin to wherever he went and so did their two daughters, Alaia, who was born January 24, 1993, and Hailey, born November 22, 1996.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Born Again Christians:</h2><p>After the birth of their first daughter, Kennya hired a Brazilian woman, Augusta, to help her around the house. Augusta ended up having a massive impact on Kennya and encouraged her to reconnect with her faith. Talking about the time Kennya was born again, Stephen <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>revealed</a>,</p><p>“She says, ‘Honey, sit down. I’ve got to talk to you. I’ve accepted Jesus Christ tonight as my Lord and Savior. I’ve been baptized in water. I need you to know that, from now on, what I need to do each day to the best of my ability is to become the most obedient servant to Jesus Christ that I can. Now, I need that to be clear, and I need you to understand. I don’t know what you’re going to do, but that’s what I’m going to do.’ Then I watched her go through this radically beautiful metamorphosis. It was amazing.”</p><p>Since then, Kennya has encouraged and subsequently enabled Baldwin to reconnect with his faith. While the pair had a hiccup in their marriage when Stephen was blamed for having an affair with a masseuse named Ruth Perez Anselmi in 2018. But Baldwin laid aside the alleged affair and continued their marriage journey. Neither Kennya nor their daughters released a comment on the affair.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kennya Baldwin Net Worth:</h2><p>As of now, Kennya Baldwin has a net worth estimated to be around $500,000 while her husband Stephen has a net worth of $3 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kennya Baldwin Body Measurement:</h2><p>Even though in her 50s Kennya has maintained a good figure and healthy weight. Kennya has a height of 5 feet 5 inches (1.65m) and a body build of 34-25-35. She weighs around 60 kg.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Divorce rumors & controversy:</h2><p>Kennya and Stephen Baldwin are married for over thirty years, and the pair are adamant to keep their marriage this way. However, the marriage seemed to be headed for a breakup in the past. Back in 2018, Stephen made headlines for his alleged relationship with a masseuse and musician Ruth Perez Anselmi. Stephen was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>reported</a> to have a two-year affair with Anselmi which began in 2016. After the publicized extramarital affair, the rumors of Kennya and Stephen Baldwin’s divorce gained traction. Nevertheless, the pair didn’t take their personal difference publicly and solved the marriage problems within the family walls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kennya-Baldwin-Stephen-Baldwin.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick bio on Stephen Baldwin:</h2><p>Stephen Baldwin is an American actor, producer, and author.
