I always liked when she played cops/detectives (I wish she would do that more often). Anyway, I remember the stories from the Canadian production of Taking Lives. Angelina <a href=#>might have had an affair with Ethan Hawke</a>, back when he was still with Uma Thurman. Incidentally, there were stories about her fooling around with Olivier Martinez on that film too. She was single and ready to mingle, and I’ve always sort of believed the Ethan rumors, even though both denied it in various ways (Ethan <a href=#>still worships her though</a>). I bring this up because the National Enquirer claims that Angelina doesn’t want Brad to spend any time with Quentin Tarantino because A) they’ll just get high and B) Uma Thurman.</p><p>BRAD PITT and fiancée Angelina Jolie are facing a thorny new crisis! Sources say the “Maleficent” star has turned up her nose at Brad’s request to socialize with his buddy, director Quentin Tarantino, and Quentin’s new squeeze, actress Uma Thurman.</p><p>“Despite Brad’s best efforts, Angelina has made it clear she won’t spend time with Quentin and Uma,” said an insider. “She claims to have no hard feelings against them, but everyone knows she thinks Quentin is a bad influence on Brad.”</p><p>Two-time Oscar winner Tarantino – who’s been dating Uma, star of his “Pulp Fiction” and “Kill Bill” movies, for several weeks – has been close to Brad since the actor starred in his 2009 film “Inglourious Basterds.” But insiders say Angelina is still fuming at Tarantino because the 51-year-old Hollywood bad boy admitted that he and Brad, 50, smoked hash together in the South of France six years ago.</p><p>But that’s not the only reason Angelina wants to keep her distance from Hollywood’s latest “it” couple. Sources say the 39-year-old sexpot also feels awkward around Uma, 44, because Angelina was accused of having an affair with the blonde bombshell’s then-husband, actor Ethan Hawke, in 2003. That’s when Angelina and Hawke, 43, shared raunchy sex scenes while co-starring in the thriller “Taking Lives.” Uma and Hawke divorced two years later while Angelina went on to lure Brad away from then-wife Jennifer Aniston.</p><p>“Angelina took huge exception to being accused of having an affair with Ethan while he was still married, and she’s always been keen to avoid any confrontation with Uma,” said the source. “Brad feels it would be good for Angie to clear the air with Uma, and going on a double date with her and Quentin is a perfect way to do it. But Angie flat-out refuses, and her stubbornness has gotten on Brad’s nerves big-time.”</p><p>Ever since Tarantino revealed his druggie night with Brad, Angie’s kept a close eye on her man’s partying – and away from Tarantino, added another source.</p><p>“It’s a real shame, because Brad’s desperate to spend more time with his Los Angeles-based friends,” said the second source. “Besides that, he was thrilled to hear Quentin is dating Uma. Everyone knows he’s been in love with her for years. But Angie won’t back down, and it’s become a major issue between them.”</p><p><a href=#>[From The National Enquirer]</a></p><p>Long story short, it’s not really an issue with Brangelina, it’s just an excuse to wonder aloud if Angelina and Ethan really did bang at some point and if Uma really does hold a grudge. I remember Ethan flaunting his rebound relationships after he and Uma split, and there really was some serious gossip that Angelina was one of those flings. And I don’t think Uma and Angelina have been in the same room ever since. Huh.</p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN, Getty.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbG9hZ355e8Cnnp6kmaOuoLbOpaCel5SksrS605iumqaklMGwq8eapaCXp57BqavUppiYrJiqv66tzZiZnpuRqsCmq86flp6smJa7oLTAsKKeZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./armored-core-6-weapons-list-armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-gameplay-plot-and-more-1555175864.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Armored Core 6 Weapons List, Armored Core 6:Fires of Rubicon Gameplay, Plot, and More">&larr;
