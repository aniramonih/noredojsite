We know which actors and actresses have scored the biggest paychecks. But which actors and actresses have managed to help the films they've appeared in make more money just with the power of their name and their performance?&nbsp; Which Hollywood names have grossed the most money in domestic box office grosses over the life of their careers? We bet some of the names on the following list will surprise you. <a href=# title="Tom Cruise Net Worth">Tom Cruise</a> has been in a number of highly successful films, but he doesn't even crack the top 10. <a href=# title="Johnny Depp Net Worth">Johnny Depp</a> has been in the incredibly successful Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, but he doesn't even crack the top 20.</p><p>Actors and actresses who've made this list have managed to accrue a high cumulative gross for the scores and scores of films they've made. Being a part of a successful franchise is one way to do it. Taking what seems like every role presented to the first actor on this list is another way to do it. &nbsp;Still, it takes something pretty special to pull in the high grossing numbers the actors (and one actress) on this list do. Whether they make us hang on to the edge of our seats, cower in fear, or laugh until we nearly pee ourselves, these 20 actors all share one thing in common â€“ they've made the most money for the films they've starred in.&nbsp;All numbers are based on domestic box office and have not been adjusted for inflation.</p><p><strong>#20) <a href=# title="Alan Rickman Net Worth">Alan Rickman</a></strong></p><p>Films: 36</p><p>Total Box Office: <strong>$3,453,301,228</strong></p><p>Average Box Office: &nbsp;$95,925,034</p><p>Factor in making this list: Playing Professor Snape in the Harry Potter franchise.</p><p><strong>#19) <a href=# title="Elizabeth Banks Net Worth">Elizabeth Banks</a></strong></p><p>Films: 42</p><p>Total Box Office: <strong>$3,464,819,134</strong></p><p>Average Box Office: &nbsp;$82,495,694</p><p>Factor in making this list: Playing Effie Trinket in the Hunger Games franchise.</p><p><strong>#18) <a title="Bruce Willis Net Worth" href=#>Bruce Willis</a></strong></p><p>Films: 75</p><p>Total Box Office: <strong>$3,523,501,796</strong></p><p>Average Box Office: &nbsp;$46,980,024</p><p>Factor in making this list: Playing John McClane in the Die Hard franchise.</p><p><strong>#17) <a href=# title="Robin Williams Net Worth">Robin Williams</a></strong></p><p>Films: 70</p><p>Total Box Office: <strong>$3,570,290,291</strong></p><p>Average Box Office: &nbsp;$51,004,147</p><p>Factor in making this List: Being one of the most beloved actors of our time.
