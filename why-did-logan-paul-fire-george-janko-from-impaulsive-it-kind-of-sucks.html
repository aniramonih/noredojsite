What happened to George is a subject of much conjecture. Everyone seemed to think that George's departure is permanent, despite the fact that people can't seem to agree on much.</p><p>This was further supported by the fact that George, soon after leaving ‘Impaulsive’ in March 2023, launched his very own podcast called 'The George Janko Show'. Fans have been curious as to what actually transpired after that point. Recently, George came clean and admitted that Logan had sacked him from the well-known show. Yet why? After all, George and Logan were close friends.</p><h2 class=split>'It kind of sucks'</h2><p>George revealed that Logan sacked him from ‘Impaulsive’, where he had worked since the company's founding in 2018, in a TikTok video posted in May 2023. He said, “Logan fired me. And we're no longer friends anymore. It kind of sucks.” A user commented on the video, "He's probably 1000% telling the truth." Another user mentioned, "I don't know why he stayed friends with these guys?'Don't be fooled, bad company corrupts good morals.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/4c44dd0f-110c-4774-87ee-e51d5aee7fdd.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2f222bd3-03ee-4a24-a212-53235c99e510.png><p>He also stated that he and Logan had grown up together and that he still thought of Logan as his best friend. George then launched into the specifics of his termination, alleging that Mike was present and had set up his books in the form of a pentagram. As the owner of Maverick Clothing had cut his hand and poured the blood into a cup, George said that it was Logan's blood. What followed was unclear, but George, a devout Christian, did not want to partake in whatever sacrilegious act Logan and Mike appeared to be committing.</p><p>Logan criticized Christianity in public in December 2022, which damaged his friendship with George. However, after Logan apologized in January 2023, the boys appeared to have made up. This time around, it doesn't seem like that's the case.</p><h2 class=split>‘Toxic environment’</h2><p>Logan appeared to poke fun at George in a new ‘Impaulsive’ episode in May 2023. Logan talks about the value of an audience in a clip from the show. He said, “I love this outlet, without people watching, I'd just have a show like...” Logan mentions a podcast, but the name is withheld from the conversation. But Mike's expression tells it all, doesn't it? Fans soon surmised that Logan was making fun of his old friend and colleague by bringing up 'The George Janko Show'.</p><p>It seems that some listeners contacted George the tape after the show aired to let him know that Logan wasn't acting well. George clarified on Twitter that he is not permitted to talk about what transpired between him and Logan. Regardless, he expressed gratitude to his supporters for drawing his attention to Logan's remark. “I've already moved on from that toxic environment,” George mentioned in his tweet.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>To the impaulsive fans, I’m so sorry I can’t speak about things! (NOT MY CHOICE) I do love you guys and for those of you sending me the clip of them talking shit, it’s all love. I’ve already moved on from that toxic environment.❤️</p>— George Janko (@GeorgeJanko) <a href=#>May 31, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>This article contains remarks made on the internet by individual people and organizations.
