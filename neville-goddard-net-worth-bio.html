Neville Goddard, a spiritual author, and philosopher gained recognition for his teachings on utilizing the Law of Assumption to manifest one’s desires. Although he was American, his teachings have gained worldwide popularity.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Introduction_of_Neville_Goddard></span>Introduction of Neville Goddard<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Neville Lancelot Goddard, who was commonly recognized as Neville Goddard, is acknowledged as a pioneer of the “law of assumption” for his writings on the Bible and esotericism as a Barbadian New Thought author and mystic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_%E2%80%93_Early_Life_Education_Personal_Life></span>Neville Goddard – Early Life, Education, Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_Early_Life></span>Neville Goddard Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>On February 19th, 1905, Neville Goddard was born in Saint Michael, Barbados, located in the British West Indies.</p><p>Neville Goddard was the fourth child of Joseph Nathaniel Goddard, a merchant, and Wilhelmina Hinkinson, who had nine boys and one girl in their family.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_Education></span>Neville Goddard Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At the age of 17, in 1922, he arrived in the United States on board the S.S. Vasari with the intention of studying drama but later transitioned to become a dancer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddards_Personal_Life></span>Neville Goddard’s Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Neville Goddard married their first wife, they have a child named Joseph Neville Goddard. However, their marriage did not last long.</p><p>For several years, Neville Goddard remained unmarried until he encountered a designer, his second wife, in the 1930s. Following they’re married, they were with a daughter born they named Victoria, or “Vicky” for short.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_Career></span>Neville Goddard Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was a dancer and also acted. In his book Consciousness is the Only Reality, he revealed that he danced for ten years in Broadway shows, vaudeville, nightclubs, and even in Europe.</p><p>In the early 1950s, he spoke about religious topics at The Town Hall. He mentioned in his 1931 lecture imagination plus faith that he once had a brief stint on television where he spoke from a lectern.</p><p>By the mid-1950s, he started his own TV show which aired on Channel 11 in L.A. every Sunday between 2 pm and 2.30 pm.</p><p>The production was simple, with Goddard speaking spontaneously about biblical esotericism in front of the camera. The show was a huge success with over 300,000 viewers tuning in every week.</p><p>Unfortunately, the show was eventually canceled because the studio was unable to secure suitable advertisers for the audience.</p><p>In 1954, he reportedly planned a metaphysical telefilm show, but it is unclear if it ever happened.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_Bio></span>Neville Goddard Bio<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthandbio.com/ezoimgfmt/i0.wp.com/networthandbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Neville-Goddard-Net-Worth.webp?resize=550%2C700&ssl=1"><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_Teacher></span>Neville Goddard Teacher<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Neville’s fascination with esoteric interpretations of the Bible grew after meeting Abdullah, an Ethiopian Jew who taught both Neville and Joseph Murphy about Esoteric Christianity.</p><p>Neville initially attended Abdullah’s lecture in protest to fulfill a friend’s request.</p><p>However, Abdullah seemed to know Neville and said he was six months late, adding that he would stay until Neville received all he had to offer.</p><p>Neville then studied under Abdullah, learning Hebrew, the Kabbalah, and the hidden symbolic meaning of Scripture.</p><p>This occupation helped to grow and the cause of Neville Goddard Net Worth to more than $2 M.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_lectures></span>Neville Goddard lectures<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Neville Goddard settled in Los Angeles in the 1950s after traveling extensively throughout the US.</p><p>He gave talks on television and radio and regularly lectured at the Wilshire Ebell Theater to full-capacity audiences. He focused on “The Law,” a technique of creating one’s reality through imagination.</p><p>He shared personal experiences of using imaginal power to make a sea voyage and be discharged from military service.</p><p>He also discussed how others had used The Law and urged people to use their imaginal power for the greater good.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_Law_of_Assumption></span>Neville Goddard Law of Assumption<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Since the subconscious can’t differentiate between reality and imagination, repeatedly imagining a fulfilled desire makes it true to the subconscious. Once an assumption is internalized, the subconscious must make it a reality.</p><p>Assuming something to be true through the Law of Assumption can shape one’s reality. To manifest desires, one must assume the feeling of already having them.</p><p>The subconscious store’s assumptions and imagination are the best way to make a new assumption stick.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddards_The_Law_and_The_Promise></span>Neville Goddard’s The Law and The Promise<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Starting in 1959, Neville began to experience what he called “The Promise,” which he claimed was Scriptural and lasted for 1,260 days.</p><p>It included the cosmology of union with the Godhead after death and future restoration for those who did not accept The Promise in life.</p><p>Neville claimed that The Law was given by God to cushion the blows of life, but the ultimate goal was to fulfill Scripture through The Promise.</p><p>In the later part of the 1960s and early 1970s, he gave more importance to The Promise than to The Law, stating that while The Law could change circumstances, it was only temporary.</p><p>The Promise, on the other hand, was unconditional and could not be earned.</p><p>In his final years, Neville believed that his work was done, and he was eager to depart for the next life, where he would know his loved ones as before, for they were all brothers infinitely in love with each other.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_Net_Worth_and_Neville_Goddard_Bio-Data></span>Neville Goddard Net Worth and Neville Goddard Bio-Data<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td>Real Name/Full Name</td><td><strong>Neville Lancelot Goddard</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Nick Name</td><td>Neville Goddard</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 19, 1905</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>67 years old</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Saint Michael, Barbados in the British West Indies</td></tr><tr><td>Parents Name</td><td><strong>Father </strong>– Joseph Nathaniel Goddard<br><strong>Mother </strong>– Wilhelmina Hinkinson</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>9 Siblings</td></tr><tr><td>Languages</td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Girlfriend</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse Name</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>(2 children) Joseph Neville Goddard, Victoria or “Vicky”</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American philosopher, Author</td></tr><tr><td>Neville Goddard Net Worth</td><td><strong>$2 million</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Date of death</td><td>October 1, 1972</td></tr><tr><td>Place of death</td><td>Los Angeles, California</td></tr></tbody></table>Neville Goddard Net Worth & Neville Goddard Bio</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_Net_Worth></span>Neville Goddard Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After earning a substantial income as a dancer, he shifted his focus entirely to becoming a full-time spiritual teacher, which significantly increased his earnings. <strong>At the time of his passing, Neville Goddard net worth had an of $2 million.</strong></p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-base-background-color has-background-dim-100 has-background-dim"></span><p class="has-text-align-left has-contrast-2-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Expand your knowledge and dive into a world of new information by checking out our related posts</strong> <strong>to “<strong>Neville Goddard</strong></strong> <strong>Net Worth</strong>“</p><ul><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Larry Huch Net Worth Bio | Larry Huch Ministries Net Worth</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Mahomes Net Worth Bio & Career</a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryuichi Sakamoto Net Worth Bio Career & Unknown Facts</a></li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_Quotes></span>Neville Goddard Quotes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Here are some of Neville Goddard’s quotes:</p><ul><li>“Never give up on your dreams.

You are a spiritual being having a human experience.”</li><li>“You are not a victim of the world. You are the creator of the world.”</li><li>“Feeling is the secret. Change your conception and you will change&nbsp;your world.”</li><li>“Sleep conceals the creative act while the objective world reveals it. In sleep, man impresses the subconscious with his conception of himself.”</li><li>“The subconscious is not selective; it is impersonal and no respecter of persons. The subconscious is not concerned with the truth or falsity of your feeling.”</li><li>“The world is your mirror. As you are within, so you see the world without.”</li><li>“Assume the feeling of the wish fulfilled. Enter into it completely, and the external world will adjust itself to your new state of consciousness.”</li><li>“The only thing you have to do to change your life is to change your imagination.”</li><li>“The world is a mirror. It reflects back to us what we are feeling and believing.”</li><li>“You are already what you want to be. You just have to believe it.”</li><li>“The only thing that prevents us from achieving our desires is our lack of belief.”</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Neville_Goddard_%E2%80%93_Cause_of_Death></span>Neville Goddard – Cause of Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At the age of 67, Goddard passed away due to a brain aneurysm on October 1, 1972.
