His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him one of the world’s highest-grossing and highest-paid actors. He aspired to play professional football but went undrafted in the 1995 NFL Draft.</p><p>After accepting an athletic scholarship to play at the University of Miami, Dwayne Johnson became a member of the 1991 national championship team, but largely spent his four college football years in backup roles behind elite players, including future NFL player and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Warren Sapp.</p><p>Following his graduation, Dwayne Johnson signed with the Calgary Stampeders but was cut from the team in his first season. In 1996, his father Rocky, a longtime professional wrestler, assisted in helping him secure a contract with the WWF.

In 2016 he voiced Maui in the Disney animated film Moana (2016). His role as Luke Hobbs in the Fast & Furious films, beginning with Fast Five (2011), helped the franchise become one of the highest-grossing in film.

In 2016 and 2019, Time named Dwayne Johnson one of the world’s most influential people.</p><p>Dwayne Johnson has been listed as one of the all-time greatest professional wrestlers as well as one of the top draws in wrestling history.
