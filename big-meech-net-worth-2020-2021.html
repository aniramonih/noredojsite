If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of Big Meech’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Big Meech, whose real name is Demetrius Edward Flenory was born on 21 June 1968 in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.&nbsp; He has a younger brother, Terry P.O. Lee “Southwest T” Flenory, who was born on 10 January 1972, in Detroit, Michigan, U.S.&nbsp; Both of them began selling $50 bags of cocaine on the streets of Detroit during their high school years itself in the 1980s.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Big Meech grew up in a very poor family, and as the years passed by, their financial condition worsened because of which he and his brother resorted to drug dealing to survive. He has a sister as well, but there isn’t much information on his relationships over the years. However, it’s well known that he once dated Sabrina Peterson.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 21 June 1968, Big Meech is 56 years old as of today’s date 21st July 2024. His height is 1.74 M tall, and his weight is 68 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Big Meech began selling cocaine in the 1980s with his brother Terry P.O. Lee “Southwest T” Flenory during their high school years. By 2000, they had established cocaine distribution cells in various states of the U.S. A year later, and they started feuding among themselves when Terry moved to LA to head his organization while Big Meech stayed at the main distribution center in Atlanta.</p><p>However, both the brothers pleaded guilty to running a criminal enterprise, and in September of 2008, both of them were sentenced to prison for 30 years. Big Meech is currently serving his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Sheridan, and will be released on 5 May 2032.</p><p>Black Mafia Family entered the hip-hop business in the early 2000s as BMF Entertainment as a promotion agency and record label under the leadership of Big Meech.&nbsp; Big Meech founded this organization not only for money laundering the cash generated by the cocaine distribution network but to also create a legal source of income. &nbsp;BMF has been featured in numerous magazines such as S.M.A.C.K. and The Come Up.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>One of the biggest achievements of Big Meech’s life is his ability to make full and best use of his resources. Take the example of him creating BMF Entertainment for money laundering generated by his cocaine distribution business. This proves how great he is when it comes to business. However, how he earned his fortune is illegal, and there’s no nice way to put it.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Big Meech in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Big-Meech-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, Big Meech has gathered a net worth of $100 Million. It’s no surprise that he has such a huge net worth as he started selling cocaine when he was just in high school. Also, by 2000 he had established networks throughout the U.S. and had direct links to Mexican drug cartels as well. He is the founder of the promotion agency and the record label, BMF Entertainment as well.</p><p>Big Meech has built a great business for him, but it has undoubtedly been because of wrong and illegal means. Let’s hope he can turn his life around when he comes out of imprisonment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZK%2Bqs4ymnJ6bmGK7psCMsKarrJhif3F%2Bj2ZpaWphZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./breaking-bad-actor-who-plays-judge-michael-desiato-on-15-across-2-wds-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Breaking Bad actor who plays Judge Michael Desiato on 15-Across: 2 wds.">&larr;
