The reason the police had visited his house was because of a complaint made by a neighbor. Michael Franchick's Son Jack was riding his gas-powered bicycle, and a neighbor yelled at him and threatened to beat him. When Michael Franchick came out, he and the neighbor got into a quarrel, and another neighbor called the police to file a complaint and mentioned that Michael had a gun. This complaint was aired on all police radios. The incident took place on September 29, 2019. This has become a million-dollar lawsuit against the Utah Police, and the hearing was in May 2020.</p><h2 id=michael_franchick_arrested class=smooth-goto>Michael Franchick Arrested</h2><p>The police officers came and knocked on Michaels's door; when he came out, he was holding his phone and recording the incident, and so were the police officers. When Michael was asked about the situation, he ran back inside the house and said that the police had entered his house without a search warrant. The Police officers grabbed Michael and started to drag him out of the house; while doing so, they tased him three times. Jack was recording everything that was happening on his phone. Michael has been arrested on counts of interfering with a police officer during arrest and failure to disclose identity.&nbsp;</p><p class=trending-main-title>TRENDING</p><a href=# aria-label="Only a Genius Brain Can Spot the Number 547 in 13 Secs"><img width=492px alt="5+8=9 Fix The Equation By Moving 1 Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img6.fresherslive.com/latestnews/2023/09/matchstick-riddle--5-8-9-fix-the-equation-by-moving-1-stick---matchstick-puzzle-64f95d5ba85fd22875177-900.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only a Genius Brain Can Spot the Number 547 in 13 Secs"><img width=492px alt="Complete Walkthrough for Starfield" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img6.fresherslive.com/latestnews/2023/09/echoes-of-the-past-starfield-walkthrough-64f6bf83e9c7822252040-900.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only a Genius Brain Can Spot the Number 547 in 13 Secs"><img width=492px alt="Only a Genius Brain Can Spot the Number 547 in 13 Secs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img6.fresherslive.com/latestnews/2023/09/optical-illusion-brain-challenge--only-a-genius-brain-can-spot-the-number-547-in-13-secs-64f725f103aee74453205-900.webp></a><a href=# aria-label="Only a Genius Brain Can Spot the Number 547 in 13 Secs"><img width=492px alt="If you have Eagle Eyes Find the Number 662 among 672 in 15 Secs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img6.fresherslive.com/latestnews/2023/07/observation-brain-test-if-you-have-50-50-vision-find-the-number-662-among-672-in-15-secs-64b0f1c7444d893001926-900.webp></a><h2 id=15_year_old_gets_2_cops_fired class=smooth-goto>15 Year Old Gets 2 Cops Fired</h2><p>After Michael's arrest, the Police officers questioned Jack about his gas-powered vehicle and the fact that he needed a driver's license. Jack was very well aware of his rights and said that if the power is 50Cc and below and you have a permit, you do not need a license. Once the police were done interrogating Jack, they moved aside to discuss amongst themselves; the police body camera recorded everything, and also them admitting that Michael had a permit for his gun and was allowed to carry it around till he did not threaten anyone with it. According to the police complaint, no one said he threatened anyone with his gun.&nbsp;</p><p>Four days later, the case was presented to the State Prosecutor, who refused and passed it onto the Park City Municipal court. The court wanted to avoid conflict, so they sent it to Salt Lake City. After a year of the case filing, Salt Lake City changed the charges against Franchick; if Franchick is convicted, he may have to go to jail for 6 months and pay a 1000$ fine.</p><h2 id=2_police_officers_fired class=smooth-goto>2 Police Officers Fired</h2><p>Towards the end of the investigation, Officer Rodrigues was charged with 5 counts of a misdemeanor, Sargent Thor with 3 counts, and Officer We're was charged with one. As the State City issued a statement that stated that the entire police department had to attend training on amendment 1 laws, this proved that amendment 1 violations had taken place. Officer Rodrigues and Sargent Thor failed to correct their behavior in the given time frame and were fired.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is for general informational purposes only.
