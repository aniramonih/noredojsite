His stories have been on several ABC shows, like World News, 20/20, ABC News Live, and Good Morning America.</p><p>In 2005, a journalist began his broadcasting career as a reporter and weekend evening anchor for “KNDO/KNDU-TV” in Yakima/Tri-Cities, Washington. After that, he worked for “KSL-TV” as a reporter and weeknight host.</p><p>In 2013, he won a Los Angeles Emmy for a series of reports that looked into fraud at auto repair shops.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Whit-Johnson-And-His-Wife-Andrea-Fujii-300x287.jpg><h2 id=whit-johnson-and-wife-andrea-fujii-age-gap><span class=ez-toc-section id=Whit_Johnson_And_Wife_Andrea_Fujii_Age_Gap></span>Whit Johnson And Wife Andrea Fujii Age Gap<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whit Johnson is a journalist who is 46 years old. His wife, Andrea Fuji, seems to be between 35 and 40 years old, based on what can be found on the web about her. Since Andreas is around the estimated age range, the age difference between the two could be between 5 and 8 years.</p><p>Whit, who is known as the reporter for “Good Morning America” on the weekends, was born on June 25, 1982, in the U.S. city of San Francisco. He got a Bachelor of Arts in TV and radio broadcasting from “San Francisco State University.” Johnson says that his stepfather, TV and radio host Dean Edell, introduced him to the media business.</p><p>In the same way, Andrea, a reporter for CBS2/KCAL9, was born in Honolulu on February 14 to an American mother, Sandra Olin Fuji, and a Japanese father, Alton Fuji. She has a lot of education. The “University of Washington” is where she got her Bachelor of Arts. She also got a degree in law from “Santa Clara University.”</p><h2 id=whit-johnson-and-andrea-fujii-net-worth-comparison-explored-their-salary-and-ear><span class=ez-toc-section id=Whit_Johnson_And_Andrea_Fujii_Net_Worth_Comparison_Explored_Their_Salary_And_Earnings></span>Whit Johnson And Andrea Fujii Net Worth Comparison: Explored Their Salary And Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Whit Johnson has been in the news for a long time. He makes $100,000 a year, and his net worth is probably $1 million. Andrea, his wife, is thought to have a net worth of $915,680. On average, she makes $98,690 a year.</p><p>In terms of their net worths, Whit is better off than Andrea. Both of them are doing well in their jobs. Both are very sweet and have unique personalities because of what has inspired them in their personal and professional lives. They have shown what they can do and made a name for themselves in the field.</p><p>She went a different way to become a journalist. It took her “a bit longer than usual,” in her words. After taking and passing the California bar exam, she decided she didn’t want to be a lawyer. Instead, she went after her dream of becoming a reporter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Children_And_Family_Of_Whit_Johnson></span>Children And Family Of Whit Johnson<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>White and Andrea got married in Hawaii on August 11, 2007, and now they have two daughters. Summer Johnson, their oldest daughter, was born on July 2, 2014, and Leah Fuji, their first daughter, was born on May 15, 2012.</p><p>Johnson was born and raised in San Francisco, California, by parents who cared about him and loved him a lot. But not much is known about his family because they try to stay out of the public eye. In 2018, he found out by accident that his father had a sibling thanks to a 23andMe DNA test.</p><p>He lives in the New York area with his wife, Andrea Fujii, who is a correspondent for ABC News, and their two children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMHRq5ynrF2Ws6etyKuqZ6einHy4tMitZKOnmKPAsLqMmqWdZZiewG7DyJ%2BcZpmemb%2BmrYyfrKOhmWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-jon-rahm-parents-where-is-jon-rahm-parents-from-what-is-jon-rahm-parents-nationality-10029646.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who are Jon Rahm Parents?
