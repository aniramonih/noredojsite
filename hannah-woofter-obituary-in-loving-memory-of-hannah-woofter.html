Hannah was a lifelong inhabitant of the Kansas City metropolitan area and touched countless lives over her eight decades as a pillar of the community.</span></p><p><span>Born in Kansas City in 1941, Hannah was the youngest of three children and grew up in a modest home on the city’s east side. From a young age, Hannah’s compassion and care for others was apparent as she volunteered at local charities and befriended classmates who were bullied or marginalized. This spirit of selflessness and service shaped Hannah’s adulthood as she balanced raising a family with teaching elementary school and leading youth programs at her church.</span></p><p><span><strong>Related posts:</strong></span></p><p><span>Hannah met her husband, Samuel Woofter, while attending Kansas City University in the 1960s. The two were married in 1965 and had four children together over the next decade. Hannah temporarily left her teaching career to focus on motherhood but returned to the classroom once her children were older. She cherished her students and strove to nurture both their minds and hearts. Outside of school, Hannah served as a den mother for the Cub Scouts, coordinated meals and activities for grieving families at her church, and organized an annual food drive for the homeless shelter downtown.</span></p><p><span>In her later years, Hannah enjoyed spending time with her nine grandchildren and volunteering at the local humane society. She also loved attending community theatre productions, taking painting classes at the recreation center, and frequenting her favorite bakery on Saturday mornings.</span></p><p><span>Hannah approached life with joy, generosity and faith. Her comforting presence, sage advice and trademark chocolate chip cookies will be deeply missed, but her legacy lives on through the many lives she touched. The Kansas City community is diminished by her loss but enriched by the memories and kindness she leaves behind.</span></p><p><span>The obituary for Hannah Woofter will be revised and expanded once precise and comprehensive details become accessible.</span></p><a href=# data-slb-active=1 data-slb-asset=573240919 data-slb-group=54930><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-54934 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/galaxylands.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Hannah-Woofter-Obituary.webp alt="Hannah Woofter, a longtime resident of the Kansas City metropolitan area passed away on October 31, 2023" width=800 height=563 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p id=caption-attachment-54934 class=wp-caption-text><span>Hannah Woofter, a longtime resident of the Kansas City metropolitan area passed away on October 31, 2023</span></p><h3><span>Who was Hannah Woofter?
