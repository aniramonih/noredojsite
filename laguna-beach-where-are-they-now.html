It’s about a group of rich teens and their complicated friendships, relationships, parties, and activities with other people. Teenage love, fights, and adventures are often part of reality shows that get a lot of viewers because they are so interesting.</p><p>Even after the students left the show, people gradually became more interested in it because it shows the problems that senior students at Laguna Beach High School face every day in their friendships and relationships. It’s been a while since the show’s production was finished. Fans are naturally interested in what their favourite high school students are doing now. We’re here to help with the same things.</p><h3>Where is Lauren Conrad Now?</h3><p>After being on the show, Lauren Conrad moved to Los Angeles to try to get a job in the fashion business. From 2006 to 2009, she was in five seasons of her spin-off show, “The Hills.” The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising was her school. While it was being made, she worked as an intern for Teen Vogue and Kelly Cutrone’s public relations firm, People’s Revolution. Later, Conrad helped start the online fair trade shop The Little Market as well as the fashion brands LC Lauren Conrad and Paper Crown. She has written nine <a href=#>books</a>, some of which are trilogies like “L.A. The Candy” and “The Fame Game” are two examples.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Lauren Conrad (@laurenconrad)</a></p><p>In August 2020, Conrad launched a line of cosmetics called Lauren Conrad Beauty. These products were made to be safe for the environment. The brand started out with four cosmetics, but by September 2020, it had grown to ten cosmetics and ten skincare items, and it was said that more products would be coming out. Lauren Conrad Beauty stopped being made in 2021.</p><p>In 2022, Lauren put out LOVED by Lauren Conrad, which was Conrad’s first fragrance. In 2019, she started a podcast called “Asking for a Friend.” It only lasted for one season, though. Since 2014, Lauren has been married to William Tell, who used to play guitar for the band Something Corporate. They have two sons together, William “Liam” James and Charles “Charlie” Wolf. The reality TV star also won the Teen Choice Awards and the Young Hollywood Awards for her role in “The Hills.”</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u480f9de141b1cac89fa505c1b42a500e><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>What Happened To Christina From Laguna Beach?</span></a><h3>Where is Lo Bosworth Now?</h3><p>Lo Bosworth is one of the original “Laguna Beach” high schoolers, and she has been doing well since the show stopped filming. The 36-year-old businesswoman is the founder and CEO of Love Wellness, the leading female-first total body care company. She has also written several books, such as “The Lo-Down” and “Love Yourself Well,” and appeared in “The Hills” and “I’m Positive.” In 2011, she started her website, The Lo Down by Lo Bosworth. Later, in 2013, she started a beauty channel on YouTube, which has over 122k subscribers and millions of views.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Lo Bosworth (@lobosworth)</a></p><h3>Where is Stephen Colletti Now?</h3><p>As the show’s “pretty boy,” it’s not surprising that Stephen turned to acting after he was on “Laguna Beach.” You may recognise him from the music video for Taylor Swift’s “White Horse,” in which he played his sweet, confident style. He got a part on “One Tree Hill.” From 2007 to 2012, he played Chase Adams.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Stephen Colletti (@stephencolletti)</a></p><p>Stephen and James Lafferty worked together to write, produce, and act in the 2018 movie “Everyone is Doing Great.” He recently worked with his ex-girlfriend Kristin to host the podcast “Laguna Beach: Back to the Beach.” The actor has been in many movies, such as “Hometown Christmas,” “The Wedding Do Over,” “The Suicide Note,” and more. In his personal life, Stephen told Alex Weaver, a NASCAR reporter, that he was dating her at the end of 2022.</p><h3>Where is Morgan Olsen Now?</h3><p>Morgan was in the first season of the show, but she wasn’t one of the original cast members. Instead, she was best friends with Christina Schuller and Lauren Conrad. Morgan was very set on going to Brigham Young University (BYU), a school for Mormons, and getting married to another Mormon. In the end, she got what she wanted by going to BYU and getting a bachelor’s degree in journalism and humanities. The reality TV star who used to be married to Joel Smith also found her true love and soulmate. Before they got married, the couple had a long-distance relationship. They met and fell in love when Morgan was in New York on business, but they didn’t get married right away.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ua831da8c144ce107713088dae5d1a41f><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>What Happened To Christina From Laguna Beach?</span></a> View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Morgan Olsen Smith (@morgansmith)</a></p><h3>Where is Trey Phillips Now?</h3><p>Trey moved to New York City after leaving Laguna. He went to the Parsons School of Design there. The fashion design and renewable energy major got his diploma in 2010. He stayed in New York City and got a job as an associate designer at Vera Wang. Trey is no longer in the <a href=#>spotlight</a>, and he stays out of the spotlight by keeping his personal life quiet. Stephen is still a good friend, and the two of them are often seen together.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by treyphillips (@treyphillips)</a></p><h3>Where is Christina Schuller Now?</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-03-30-055855-1-1.jpg alt="laguna beach season 3 where are they now,sam from laguna beach,where is stephen from laguna beach now,laguna beach season 3 cast,where is jessica from laguna beach now,where is christina from laguna beach now,laguna beach season 4 cast,laguna beach season 3 where are they now tessa,laguna beach season 2 cast,laguna beach where are they now season 3,laguna beach where are they now tessa,laguna beach where are they now alex h,laguna beach 3 where are they now,laguna beach season 4 where are they now,laguna beach season three where are they now,is laguna beach coming back,laguna beach show where are they now,is anyone from laguna beach still friends,cast of laguna beach where are they now,laguna beach reunion where to watch,laguna beach the real orange county where are they now,laguna beach main beach address,laguna beach show locations" width=256 height=130 sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>During her time in Laguna Beach, Christina Sinclair (formerly Schuller) made it clear that she wanted to be an actress. Now, though, she cares more about living a healthy life. After the show ended, Christina married Chad Sinclair, and now she works in Laguna Beach as a certified fitness instructor. She also runs the website Beach Babe Fitness, where she gives advice about what to eat and how to work out. Christina had her first child, a son named Christian Sutton, in May 2014. In January 2017, she had her second child, a girl named Cienna Estelle. She works at the health and beauty company Equinox right now.</p><h3>Where is Kristin Cavallari Now?</h3><p>Kristin Elizabeth Cavallari is a fashion designer, author, and TV personality who is 36 years old.
