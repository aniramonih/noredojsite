Allegedly, he posed as a casting director at a talent agency and then pressured five actors to film degrading videos of themselves as "auditions" for acting roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's everything we know about this mess.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joey allegedly tricked aspiring actors into thinking he was a casting director.</h2><p>An aspiring actor, Ben Shimkus, wrote about his alleged experience with Joey in a lengthy Facebook post. There, he explained he met the drag performer at State University of New York College at Cortland, where they both studied musical theater together.&nbsp;</p><p>After Joey left SUNY Cortland, Ben received a tip from a friend about an available role at Playwrights Horizons in New York City. Ben was advised to reach out to a casting director named, Allison Mossey.</p><p>"Allison and I went through an email thread that lasted over 150 emails in about three weeks," Ben wrote. "We covered topics of pay, living situations in the city, when I would have to leave school for rehearsals, and conversations about acting choices for the character."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>I have a weird story to tell about Sherry Pie RuPaul’s Drag Race Season 12 started last week.

Daniel Lynn Evans, the owner of the Broadway Barber, told BuzzFeed News that he met Sherry Pie in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>“About a week later, I got an Instagram message from her seemingly trying to make up for my missed job opportunity, trying to help me get cast in something that wanted ‘big’ guys," he told BuzzFeed. "I was still a little sour about what had happened, but a job is a job, so, like, whatever — just tell me what I need to do.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“In light of recent developments and Sherry Pie’s statement, Sherry Pie has been disqualified from RuPaul’s Drag Race....</p>— RuPaul's Drag Race (@RuPaulsDragRace) <a href=#>March 6, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joey apologized for his actions via Facebook.</h2><p>Joey wrote an apology via Sherry Pie's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Facebook</u></a> page.
