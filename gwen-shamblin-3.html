David Shamblin was from Tennessee. The couple raised their two children, Michael and Elizabeth, together throughout their forty-year marriage, which ended in 2018.</p><p style=text-align:justify>After her marriage to David ended in divorce, Gwen wed the actor Joe Lara, whose real name is William Joseph Lara.
