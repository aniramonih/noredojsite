While her parents are famous worldwide, she has not yet appeared in the limelight.</p><p>Hence, this article focuses on Tia’s age, weight loss journey, net worth, and many more. So, don’t miss out on reading this article till the end.</p><h2>Tia Mann Age and Early life</h2><p>David Mann’s daughter Tia Mann is currently 31 years of age, born on May 25, 1990. She belongs of African descent but has an American nationality, born in Mansfield, Texas. Also, if you do not know, her birth name is<strong> La’Tia Mann</strong>.</p><p>Apart from being a celebrity daughter, she is also a singer and makeup entrepreneur. The singer was born to father David Mann, a legendary singer, actor, stand-up comedian, and mother Tamela Mann, a professional singer. Being born to such talented musician parents, her interest in music grew from an early age.</p><p>Furthermore, she is not the only kid of her parents and has three more siblings named Three-Tiffany Mann, Porcia Mann, and David Mann Jr. Also, if you’re wondering about her academic background, she went to Mansfield High School and Mansfield Timberview High School.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-9148 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tia-Mann-parents.jpg alt="Tia Mann parents, David and Tamela" width=832 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-9148 class=wp-caption-text>Legendary Gospel singer David Mann and his wife, Tamela</p><h2>Tia Mann Weight Loss Surgery</h2><p>Tia Mann went through a&nbsp;<strong>weight loss</strong> journey and incredible body transformation following her mother, Tamela Mann. Tamela went through a body transformation in 2019, and she stated that her journey had no strict diet routines. Tamela had simply incorporated WW’s program to shed 40 pounds of her body weight and even became an ambassador for WW.</p><p>After the program actually worked on her, her daughter Tia Mann followed her in her journey, and she has pretty much succeeded in it. However, such sources have documented the weight-loss surgery that she planned back on May 9, 2017. The article mentions how her family was worried about her weight-loss surgery after her mother; Tamela, had several complications during her surgery.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Tia has followed the track of her father David and Tamela as she has become a great singer just like their parents. As we mentioned earlier, she has music in her gene, and no matter what, it leads her back to her musical career. However, Tia is also a makeup entrepreneur who owns a makeup line called Tilly’s Cosmetics. She learned everything about business like marketing, branding, launching a business and only stepped into her makeup line in 2017. She has launched a set of lipstick, eye shadows, highlighters, and eyelashes throughout these years.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income Sources</h2><p>Tia Mann has accumulated a good amount from her career as a singer and mainly as a makeup entrepreneur. With the makeup line she started back in 2017 and her successful musical career, she has earned a <strong>net worth</strong> of $1 million as of 2021. Besides this, her <a href=#>YouTube</a> channel also might contribute a certain amount to her wealth. Hence, in years to come, her worth would reach more than $1 million with her makeup line and career in singing.</p><h2>Is Tia Mann married to a husband?</h2><p>Well, while we tried our best to explore Tia’s relationship status, we came to know that she had not tied her wedding knots with anyone till now. However, she has been <a href=#>linked</a> to her boyfriend named <strong>Justin Pearson</strong>. They met each other in 2017 when Justin was working for David and Tamela to provide lights and LED screens for their musical concerts and functions. They eventually fell in love after a couple of months, and their relationship bloomed like a flower. Although they are still together and in love, the love birds have not revealed their wedding plans.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-9149 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritygen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tia-Mann-Boyfriend-Justin-Pearson.jpg alt="Tia Mann and her boyfriend, Justin Pearson" width=480 height=360 sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-9149 class=wp-caption-text>The singer, Tia Mann, and her boyfriend, Justin Pearson</p><h2>Tia Mann Parents Relationship</h2><p>Tia Mann’s parents David and Tamela, have been in a conjugal life for more than three decades. They tied their wedding knots on June 9, 1988, in a private family function, and ever since then, they have held on to each other and embraced their wedding oaths for more than 33 years now. In fact, the two recharged their marriage in 2013 on their 25 wedding anniversary. They have represented a perfect example of an ideal relationship among all of us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCgnZ5jsLC5jq2gmmWdlruvecOaraKcXaKur7qO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./richest-rock-stars-in-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 20 Richest Rockstars In The World">&larr;
