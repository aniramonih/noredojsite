He is also one of the most successful Filipino musicians of all time, with a net worth of $20 million as of 2023. But his journey to stardom was not easy. He had to overcome many challenges and hardships, from losing his mother at a young age to living on the streets for years. Here is his inspiring story of how he achieved his dreams through his talent and perseverance.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Struggles</h3><p>Arnel Pineda was born on September 5, 1967, in Tondo, Manila, Philippines. He was the eldest of four children of Restituto and Josefina Pineda, who were both tailors. His mother encouraged him to sing from a young age, and he often joined singing contests as a child. He also developed a love for rock music, especially Queen and Led Zeppelin.</p><p>However, his life took a tragic turn when his mother died of heart disease when he was 13 years old. His family was left in debt and could not afford to pay their rent. His father decided to move out and ask relatives to take care of his siblings. Arnel, feeling responsible for his family, dropped out of school and started working odd jobs. He also lived on the streets for about two years, sleeping in parks or benches, and surviving on scraps of food.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Musical Career and Breakthrough</h3><p>Despite his hardships, Arnel never gave up on his passion for music. In 1982, when he was 15 years old, he became the lead singer of a Filipino band called Ijos. He sang in a pizza parlor and other venues with the band. In 1986, he joined another band called Amo, which won several contests in the Philippines and Hong Kong. He also sang with other bands such as Intensity Five, New Age, and Most W@nted.</p><p>In 1999, Arnel formed his own band called The Zoo, which became popular in the Philippines and other Asian countries. They performed covers of classic rock songs as well as original compositions. Arnel also released solo albums such as Arnel Pineda (2006) and Zoology (2007).</p><p>However, his biggest break came in 2007, when he was discovered by Neal Schon, the guitarist of Journey, through YouTube videos of him singing Journey songs with The Zoo. Schon was impressed by Arnelâ€™s voice and invited him to audition for Journey in San Francisco. Arnel passed the audition and became the new lead singer of Journey, replacing Steve Perry.</p><p>Since then, Arnel has toured and recorded with Journey, earning acclaim from fans and critics alike. He has also performed with other famous artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Roger Taylor, Jonathan Cain, and more. He has also been involved in charitable causes such as supporting typhoon victims in the Philippines.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth and Lifestyle</h3><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Arnel Pineda has a net worth of $20 million as of 2023. He earns most of his income from his music career with Journey and The Zoo, as well as from his solo projects and endorsements. He also owns several properties in the Philippines and the United States.</p><p>Arnel is married to Cherry Pineda since 2001. They have four children: Cherub, Matthew, Angelo, and Thea. They divide their time between the Philippines and the United States. Arnel is known for his humble and down-to-earth personality. He is also grateful for his fans and supporters who have helped him achieve his dreams.</p><p>Arnel Pineda is an example of how talent, hard work, and determination can overcome any obstacle in life. He is a living proof that nothing is impossible if you believe in yourself and your dreams. He is truly an inspiration to many people around the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX528uHnAq6WepF2ltq%2Bxw5pksJ2eqXqnvs6mZKWhpp67qHnOp2StoJViwLW%2BxJ6rrGWkpHqprdWipaBlkWK7psCMsKarrJhivKd5kWlkpqGcobawuo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-did-zach-bryan-lose-his-mom-country-singers-wife-elisabeth-and-divorce-449163-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Did Zach Bryan Lose His Mom?
