By profession, the guy is the head coach of the NBL franchise Denver Broncos.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table id=factsDetail class=highlight><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Anne Fangio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Name</strong></td><td>Anne</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Name</strong></td><td>Fangio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Celebrity Ex-wife</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Country</strong></td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender Identity</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sexual Orientation</strong></td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>No Of Children</strong></td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>After their marriage, Anne moved from Doyle to Fangio.</h2><p>Following her marriage to Vic, Anne’s name was changed from Anne Patricia Doyle to Anne Fangio. When it comes to Vic, he has done a lot in his professional career, leading his club to an incredible record franchisee in 2019. Taking a peep inside his personal life, the two met in the 1980s. Do you believe in the first sight connection? It may not be for many of you, but it may resonate with a few of you; that’s all that occurred with Vic and Anne. The initial encounter created a strong bond between them, which led to a relationship. They developed a particular affinity over time, after which they decided to marry formally in 1990. Anne has been at his side during the crazy, demanding agenda.</p><h2>How many children does this ex-couple have?</h2><p>The former couple has two children. Christian Victor Fangio, a boy, was born in 1991, and Cassandra Cassie Fangio, a daughter, was born in 1996. In terms of current updates on their child’s life, their son has worked as an inside linebacker at Marriottsville. He just accepted a position as a specialist with Apple, a globally known firm. Christian resides in Baltimore, Maryland. Cassandra, their second child, graduated from Towson University with a nursing degree. The woman is now a member of the United States Army.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/voxhour.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anne-Fangio-1.jpg><h2>Anne and her husband Vic Fangio divorced.</h2><p>The pair have separated and divorced. Anne and Vic have been together for a long time. Despite this, the couple agreed that going on with their lives apart would be the best decision for both of them. The reason for this major move has yet to be made known in the media. They are separated as a marriage, but they are never lazy in their duties as parents regarding their children. They constantly stood up and stared at them.</p><h2>Are Vic and his new girlfriend throwing a wedding?</h2><p>On the other hand, Vic went on with his life after the divorce. Vic was fortunate enough to acquire a new love interest in his life following Anne. That is the woman who has entered his life? Kathy is her given name. They have been in a relationship for a long time, according to reports. Aside from her name, nothing more about her is known. The couple is now residing in San Francisco. It’s tough to determine if they’re planning a wedding or not. Moving on to his ex-wife, she has stayed out of the spotlight since her divorce from Vic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/voxhour.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Anne-Fangio-2.jpg><h2>Vic Fangio has a deep relationship with his daughter.</h2><p>Regardless of his prior relationships, Vic has a strong attachment with his daughter Cassie. The father-daughter bond is much greater than any of them. We must have observed how much praise we give one other in interviews or public. Despite his father’s rigorous schedule, his daughter constantly finds time for him and visits training grounds where her father is busy teaching his teams. Observing the team’s enthusiasm and performance, the daddy’s kid described her father as a wonderful and astute coach. What more can we ask for?</p><h2>Anne Fangio Net worth in 2024</h2><p>Anne is employed in the corporate sector at PCG Public Partnerships. <strong>Her ex-spouse, a head coach, has a net worth of $4 million as of January 2024</strong>&nbsp;since her real salary cannot be determined.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiun621sMHRZ5qopV%2BWu6%2BxjJ%2BYp5%2BZpHqiusNmn56qXZ3CtK7Ap5tmrpmYeqetzaCgqGWjpbmqwIyup2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./annie-ilonzeh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Annie Ilonzeh- Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Dating">&larr;
