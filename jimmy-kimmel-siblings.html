He was born on November 4, 1979, in Brooklyn, New York in the United States of America and he is currently 47 years of age. He is an American television and film director, writer, producer, actor and composer.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jill Kimmel?</h2><p>Jill Kimmel is the sister of the younger brother of the American TV presenter and comedian, Jimmy Kimmel. She has a unique and refreshing comedic flair. The endearing comedian finds humor in the mundane annoyances of motherhood, handling office politics, and overcoming the unanticipated consequences of weight loss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/29090515/john-kimmel-jimmy-kimmel.webp?resize=630%2C423&ssl=1"><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jimmy Kimmel career</h2><p>Kimmel got his start in radio while still in high school, taking inspiration from David Letterman’s early career. He hosted a Sunday-night interview program on KUNV, the collegiate radio station of UNLV.</p><p>He gained popularity as a caller to the KZZP-FM afternoon show in Phoenix, Arizona, which was hosted by radio hosts Mike Elliott and Kent Voss, while he was a student at Arizona State University.</p><p>Together with Voss, Kimmel accepted his first paid position in 1989 as co-host of The Me and Him Show on KZOK-FM in Seattle, Washington’s morning drive. The hosts did a number of on-air stunts over the next ten months, one of which cost them $8,000 in lost advertising revenue.</p><p>Kimmel and Voss were fired from KZOK in 1990, and then from WRBQ-FM in Tampa a year later. Later, Kimmel became the host of his own program at KCMJ in Palm Springs, California, where he hired Carson Daly a boyhood friend of the family as an intern.</p><p>Kimmel ended up at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles following a morning shift at KRQQ in Tucson, Arizona. He was “Jimmy The Sports Guy” on the Kevin and Bean morning show for five years. He made friends with the comedian Adam Carolla at that period.</p><p>At first, Kimmel had no desire to work in television. He started writing promos and commentary for Fox broadcasters, and soon after, he was asked to do the on-air work himself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He turned down multiple television program proposals from producer Michael Davies because he wasn’t interested in the projects until he was asked to play Ben Stein’s comic foil on the game show Win Ben Stein’s Money, which debuted on Comedy Central in 1997.</p><p>Stein’s monotone speech style and faux-patrician demeanor were contrasted with his quick wit and “everyman” mentality. The duo won an Emmy for Best Game Show Host thanks to their collaboration.</p><p>Kimmel made an appearance in Fox Network promotions as “Jimmy the Fox Guy” in the spring of 1996. His other television experience included four years as Fox NFL Sunday’s on-air football prognosticator.</p><p>He has frequently been on many talk shows, such as The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Howard Stern Show, Live with Regis and Kelly, and Late Show with David Letterman.</p><p>The most recent of his five appearances on The Late Show was in 2010. Kimmel was the roastmaster for both the Comedy Central roast of Pamela Anderson and the Hugh Hefner roast at the New York Friars’ Club. He has made an appearance on Dancing with the Stars on ABC.</p><p>ABC said in August 2006 that Kimmel would be the host of their brand-new game program, Set for Life. On July 20, 2007, the program made its debut. Kimmel replaced Larry King on Larry King Live on April 6, 2007.</p><p>From October 22 to October 26, 2007, Kimmel served as a guest host on Live with Regis and Kelly. During that week, Jimmy commuted daily between New York and Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/29090342/13423495_web1_Kimmel-sister-Kabik-Photo-Group-1024x821.webp?resize=770%2C617&ssl=1"><p>By doing so, he shattered the record for the greatest mileage traveled in a workweek, which stood at 22,406 miles (36,059 kilometers). Kimmel has questioned the record himself, arguing that the record should really belong to the Pope or a world leader.</p><p>Kimmel has voiced dogs in a number of animated movies. He provided the voice of Death’s Dog in the Family Guy episode “Mr. Saturday Knight” and could be heard in Garfield: The Movie and Road Trip.</p><p>Seth MacFarlane, the show’s creator, later gave Jimmy Kimmel a figurine of the character on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Kimmel provided voice acting for Robot Chicken as well. Sal Iacono, Kimmel’s cousin, agreed to wrestle Santino Marella, and he prevailed.</p><p>In the midst of a scheduling difficulty the 2010 Tonight Show host, Kimmel was Jay Leno’s special guest on The Jay Leno Show’s “10 at 10” segment on January 14, 2010.</p><p>On September 23, 2012, Kimmel hosted the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. On September 18, 2016, she hosted the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards. With the presidential election in a few weeks, Kimmel brought up Mark Burnett’s contribution to Trump’s ascent.</p><p>Kimmel established Kimmelot, his second production business, in November 2018. A celebrity version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire debuted for the show’s 20th anniversary in 2020 and aired until 2021, with Kimmel serving as both host and co-executive producer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/29090323/jontahan-and-jimmy-kimmel.webp?resize=770%2C433&ssl=1"><p>On April 8, 2020, ABC debuted it. Kimmel’s return to host the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards on September 20, 2020, was announced in June 2020.</p><p>The Solemn Goose, an interactive children’s picture book with Kimmel’s own artwork, was published in July 2019. The book urges readers to assist in making the solemn goose happy.</p><p>In an effort to assist its employees who are unemployed as a result of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, John Oliver, and Kimmel launched the comedic podcast Strike Force Five on August 30, 2023.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOgpqWpYriqucyeo2armZe5qrrGrGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jon-gordon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jon Gordon">&larr;
