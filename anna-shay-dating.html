But this is not true; they are just good friends who like to spend time together. Anna Shay has been married four times, each time to a different man.</p><p>Bling Empire is a Netflix show that shows how super-rich Asian Americans live. Because of this, everyone on the show has Asian ancestors. The second season of the reality TV drama “Bling Empire” came out on May 13, 2022. It was made by<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Christine Chiu</a>.</p><p><strong>The news comes before the October 5, 2022 premiere of the third season of Bling Empire. One of them is Dorothy Wang, who was in the second season of Bling Empire.</strong></p><p>Jeff Jenkins Productions makes the show, and Jeff Jenkins, Russell Jay-Staglik, Elise Chung, Leonid Rolov, Ross Weintraub, and Reinout Oerlemans are the executive producers.</p><p><strong>Anna Shay is one of the people in the Bling Empire who doesn’t want to get involved in gossip.</strong> On the show, she has often seen shopping, posing for photos, and relaxing with her friend Maria Jose Lainez in her mansion. Because of this, a lot of people have been wondering about Anna and Maria’s relationship and if they are dating.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Anna Shay (@annashay93)</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Maria “Bling Empire”</h2><p>We were fascinated by the enigmatic Maria. She does have an Instagram account, boasting close to 1,500 followers. According to her photos, Maria appears to be having the time of her life, and many of the images include her best friend Anna.</p><p><strong>Maria and Anna are seen posing together on the red carpet for the Bling Empire Season 2 premiere in one very pleasant photo.</strong> Maria was 56 years old when she appeared on Bling Empire Season 2 according to Gossip Next Door. She was born on August 13th.</p><p>Maria also publishes photos of her family. Carmen Lainez and Gloria Maria are her two daughters. Maria is a quieter presence on Bling Empire, but her motivational Instagram profile says a lot about who she is: The phrase “Happiness isn’t a goal, it’s a feeling” loosely translates to “Feeling happy isn’t a goal, it’s a feeling.”</p><h2>Anna Shay Isn’t Dating Maria Jose Lainez; They’re Just Best Friends</h2><p>During the second season of Bling Empire, Anna Shay, 61, and her friend Maria Jose Lainez, @mariaa.lainezz, moved into their beautiful Beverly Hills home. Like Florent Bonadei, Maria was brought to Bling Empire by Anna as one of her friends. But they are not dating each other at all.</p><p>On each other’s Instagram, especially Maria’s, you can often see Maria and Anna posing with a “BFF” caption. People must have thought they were a good match because of how close they were. But they’re just best friends and nothing more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-78-1024x576.png><p>Maria was 56 years old when she was in the second season of Bling Empire. In Bling Empire Season 2, Episode 6, when Anna, Kane, and Kim were having that awkward conversation about Christine allegedly slandering Anna’s name, Maria said that Anna should be thankful that Kane came to her with his worries about the trouble.</p><p>Maria also shows pictures of her family, including Carmen Lainez and Gloria Maria, her two daughters. Maria has a more quiet role on Bling Empire, but her inspiring Instagram bio gives a glimpse into who she is: The phrase “La Felicidad no es un meta, es sentimiento de uno” loosely translates to “Happiness isn’t a goal, it’s a feeling.”</p><p>Anna’s private life is different from everyone else’s. Most of her fans don’t understand her because she doesn’t talk about anything personal. There are many rumors about Anna’s romantic interests, but not much is known about them. We do know, though, that the actress had been married before. Four times, to be exact.</p><p>Anna has been married four times before, but she doesn’t want to talk about them or share details about them. Anna Shay is doing a great job! From what is known about Anna’s previous marriages, we know that she has a son named Kenny Kemp from one of them.</p><p>Kenny Kemp, a 28-year-old son, is probably best known as one of the best marijuana paraphernalia collectors in the United States. Kenny stays out of sight, like his mother, but it looks like he stores his bongs in the basement, too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Much Money Does Anna Shay Have And What Does She Do For A Living?</h2><p>In 2006, Anna Shay and her younger brother Allen Shay sold their dad’s business for $1.2 billion. Her father didn’t want her to work as long as he was alive, but she did a lot of charity work. She used to be on the board of the George Lopez Foundation, which raises awareness about kidney disease and organ donation. She has also worked for the Shay Foundation, which was started by her late parents and supports education, the arts, music, and performing arts.</p><p>Because of the show, she is now, of course, a reality TV star. But she never thought this would happen to her. People, she said,</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Anna Shay (@annashay93)</a></p><p><strong>Did I expect the show to be successful? No, I wasn’t even expecting to be in front of the camera. I’m very shy and I went along with whatever situation was happening. I was just being me. I think the success of the show has a lot to do with how Netflix, Jeff Jenkins, and his production company handled things. It’s really thanks to them</strong>.</p><h2 class="sc-euEtjk TVCyU" data-header=true>Is Maria as rich as Anna?</h2><p>According to an earlier Distractify story, Anna had a net worth of at least $600 million, based on the proceeds she earned from the sale of her wealthy father’s business. Her best friend must be quite wealthy if she can afford the Alexander McQueen outfits she sports in Bling Empire Season 2, Episode 6.</p><p>Maria’s actual net worth is unknown, but according to The Gossip Next Door, she is at least $5 million in wealth. Maria does share a lot of posh travel photos.</p><p>But what we adore about Maria is how genuine she is. It was Maria who made the observation that Anna should be appreciative that Kane approached her with his concerns regarding the drama during the aforementioned uncomfortable conversation that Anna, Kane, and Kim had concerning Christine supposedly slandering Anna’s name in Bling Empire Season 2, Episode 6.</p><p>Maria expressed her opinion that he merited praise for doing that. Maria again inquired if anyone wanted something to eat once they finished talking. “Sandwich? You enjoy eating, “Even though Kane, Kim, and Anna disagree, she continues. We hope Maria will be back if Bling Empire is extended for a third season because she brought a rare piece of sincere humor to a show that feeds on the drama!</p><p>Bling Empire Season 2 is currently available on Netflix. A sandwich should be purchased in Maria’s honor before you begin streaming.</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Marvel And Dc Stars Attend James Gunn And Jennifer Holland’s Marriage</a></li><li><a href=#>Who Is Kim Kardashian Currently In A Relationship With After Divorce With Pete Davidson?</a></li></ul><p>Join the conversation and stay informed!
