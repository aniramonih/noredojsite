He was born into a middle-class Christian family from New Jersey, in the United States of America. His mother is Kimberly Chapman, while his father is an American businessman.</p><p>Joe is Caucasian, and although his surname sounds Italian, the popular TikToker has no Italian roots that we know of. He grew up with an older sister named Angelina Bartolozzi, who is also a fairly well-known social media influencer.</p><p>Joe’s religion is Atheism—although he was born into a very religious Christian family and even sports a cross-chain regularly, Joe has opined severally that he doesn’t believe in God. Joe, at such a young age, has achieved quite a lot from his vlogging career. Here are five important facts we need to know about the TikToker extraordinaire.</p><h2><strong>Five Eye-Opening Facts About Joe Bartolozzi</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. The Internet Celebrity is Originally From New Jersey</strong></h3><p>The young social media star is a native of New Jersey, USA. He is the son of Kimberly E. Chapman. His maternal grandparents are Philo W Chapman and Maxine Chapman. Not much is known about Joe’s paternal family.</p><p>The young star had his high school education at a local high school in New Jersey, United States. He is an alumnus of the St. Augustine Preparatory School. As a high school student, Joe participated heavily in sports, especially track and field sports. This is why he refers to himself as an athlete.</p><p>For his degree, he schooled at a private college in his hometown of New Jersey. He has not opened up about what specific course he is studying. However, a very impressive fact to note about the YouTuber is that he is currently sponsoring himself in college—meaning Joe pays his tuition himself.</p><h3><strong>2. Joe Bartolozzi Makes Mostly Comedic Videos With a Sarcastic Twang</strong></h3><p>Joe Bartolozzi is a comedian, at least, his videos say he is. He started trying his hands at making funny videos when he was still in high school. However, being a comedian isn’t exactly an out-of-the-box career. Still, Joe carved a solid niche for himself by approaching his comedy through the lens of biting sarcasm and comedic anger. He started writing comedy scripts while still in elementary school and learned from watching TV shows and other vloggers.</p><p>Joe began uploading content on the app called Musical.ly, which eventually became TikTok. He gradually started expanding to other platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, and Twitch. His videos cover a wide variety of subjects ranging from his day-to-day activities to bizarre, weird content. He also made lip-syncing very popular among TikTok users.</p><p>His first YouTube video, titled ‘Why I Hate Public Bathrooms,’ was uploaded in July 2020. Since then, he has made other popular videos like ‘Morgz Buys Fake Jewelry For Views?!?!’, which is his most viewed video to date.</p><h3><strong>3. Bartolozzi Has Over 22 Million Followers Across All Social Media Platforms</strong></h3><p>Joe’s current biggest platform is TikTok. His TikTok page reigns supreme with over 20.2 million followers plus over 1 billion likes on his videos so far. His official YouTube page comes next with a total of 1.13 million subscribers.</p><p>On the gaming platform Twitch, Joe Bartolozzi currently has over 1 million followers as well. His least popular platform at the moment is Instagram, and even that has impressive followership of 342,000. In total, Joe Bartolozzi boasts over 22.6 million followers across all social media platforms he is active on, as well as millions of views on each platform.</p><h3><strong>4. Joe Bartolozzi’s Net Worth Makes Him a Millionaire</strong></h3><p>According to a recent report by Net Worth Spot, Joe Bartolozzi’s current net worth is estimated to be about $1.5 million. Of course, most of his earnings come from the monetization of his social media accounts. On TikTok, the New Jersey native makes about $16,000 each month from his views alone. This figure excludes what he makes from brand-sponsored deals.</p><p>On Instagram, he earns an estimated $5k for each brand-sponsored post he makes. On the vlogging site YouTube, Joe earns the most, with total earnings amounting to over $300 thousand. He earns about $2k to $3k per video on YouTube, and he has currently uploaded 48 videos so far. Lastly, on Twitch, Joe typically earns an estimated $5k per stream.</p><h3><strong>5. Joe Has Maintained a Relatively Scandal Free Career So Far</strong></h3><p>Despite how dicey the industry of social influencers is, some brand influencers have managed to maintain a sterling reputation throughout their social media careers. Joe Bartolozzi is certainly one of them. The YouTuber appears to be completely focused on his sports and vlogging careers, as well as his education.</p><p>Since he began his YouTube career in 2020, Joe hasn’t been in any public fights, nor has he been the subject of any call-outs or scandals. We can only hope things remain this way for the young internet celebrity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdn7ymecGaqa2nnKTHu7WMbmStoJmjtLR506hkpKafrHqirs6uq2asmJp6pLvNrZynrF2Yv6at06ipaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-mariah-the-scientist-engaged-to.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Mariah The scientist engaged to?">&larr;
