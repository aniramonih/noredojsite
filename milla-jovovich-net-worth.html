Milla Jovovich is probably best known for her action heroine roles in the Resident Evil movies and other sci-fi films. Outside of acting, Milla Jovovich is an established musician. She also owns her own production company and enjoys an incredibly successful modeling career.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Milica Bogdanovna Jovovich was born on December 17th of 1975 in Kiev, Ukraine. Born into the Soviet Union, Milica was raised mostly in Moscow, admitting later that she was born in Ukraine by a mere coincidence. Her mother was a Soviet Russian actress, and her father was a doctor. When Milla was just five years old, her family emigrated to London, England.</p><p>Next, the family relocated to California, eventually settling in Los Angeles. Eventually, her parents divorced. Although her mother tried to continue her acting career in Los Angeles, the language barrier proved to be too difficult to overcome. Money was an issue for the family after moving to the United States, and eventually, both parents took jobs as cleaners and cooks. Eventually, her father was imprisoned for participating in the largest health insurance fraud in American history. He was given twenty years, although he only served 5.</p><p>Milla Jovovic was adjusting well to her new surroundings during this time, although she was teased at school for being Russian. She eventually became fluent in English in just three months. Milla left school at age 12 to focus on modeling, a pursuit she had begun 3 years prior. Although Jovovic admitted to committing petty crimes like vandalism, credit card fraud, and drug use during her teen years, she was committed to becoming a successful model or actress and had her mother's full support.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>While other children were attending high school, Milla was attending schools for young actors. At age 13, she made her first film appearance with Two Moon Junction. After appearing in a range of television series, Milla booked major roles in films such as Return to the Blue Lagoon and Dazed and Confused despite still being a relatively young teen. Her big break came in 1997 when she booked a leading role in the cult favorite sci-fi movie The Fifth Element, a film that grossed over $263 million. Further roles came with He Got Game, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, and Zoolander.</p><p>In 2002, Milla Jovovich's career took another leap forward when she booked the leading role in the film Resident Evil. Adapted from a successful video game franchise, the film performed equally well at the box office with earnings of over $100 million. In total, Jovovich starred in six Resident Evil movies, and the franchise has collectively earned over $1.2 billion at the box office. In spite of consistently negative reviews from critics, this makes the Resident Evil movies the highest-grossing franchise ever to be adapted from a video game series.</p><p>Outside of the Resident Evil franchise, Jovovich is also known for appearing in films like The Fourth Kind, The Three Muskateers, Zoolander 2, Future World, Paradise Hills, and the Hellboy reboot in 2019.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-166447 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Milla-Jovovich-pic.jpg alt="Milla Jovovich" width=470 height=601 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-166447 class=wp-caption-text>Valerie Macon/Getty Images</p><h2 id=music><strong>Music</strong></h2><p>Milla Jovovich signed a record deal in 1988 when she was just 13.

In addition to contributing songs to several of her films' soundtracks, Milla Jovovich has collaborated with artists such as The Crystal Method and <a href=# title="Deepak Chopra Net Worth">Deepak Chopra</a>.</p><h2 id=highest-paid-model><strong>Highest Paid Model</strong></h2><p>Jovovich's work as a model was incredibly lucrative. At times during her modeling days she was the highest paid model in the world. For example, in 2004 she earned a bit a bit more than $10.5 million. Her early work as a young teen soon led to appearances on the covers of magazines like Cosmopolitan and Vogue. Some of her biggest projects have been with brands like Banana Republic, <a href=# title="Christian Dior Net Worth">Christian Dior</a>, Versace, and <a href=# title="Giorgio Armani Net Worth">Giorgio Armani</a>, to name but a few.</p><p>Although Jovovich has stated that modeling was "never a priority" for her, she is well respected in the industry by figures such as <a href=# title="Miuccia Prada Net Worth">Miuccia Prada</a> and <a href=# title="Gianni Versace Net Worth">Gianni Versace</a>.

S. Anderson purchased a property in Beverly Hills for around $3.922 million. It was immediately clear that this was an investment property, as the couple rented out the apartment for $20,000 per month soon after their purchase. In 2018, they listed the 2,400 square-foot, minimalist property for $4.5 million. They sold this property in late 2021 for $4.6 million.</p><p>In 2005, Jovovich and Anderson purchased a townhouse in New York's West Village for $6.375 million, again renting out the property soon after their acquisition. The four-floor West Village townhouse is 3,098 square feet with 4 bedrooms, and 3.5 bathrooms. The front door opens to a small foyer leading to a parlor.
