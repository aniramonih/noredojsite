Cause of death Jasmyn Lambert&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span>A community in Cobb County, Georgia, USA, is in profound mourning following the tragic and heart-wrenching death of teacher Jasmyn Lambert last Saturday.</span></p><p><span>Jasmyn Lambert, aged 35, was a beloved third-grade teacher at Still Elementary School in Cobb County. She consistently brought boundless love, attentive care, and meaningful lessons to her students. The third-grade students eagerly looked forward to attending her class, where they could meet their cheerful and joyful teacher. To them, Jasmyn was like a second mother and an ideal role model.</span></p><p><span>On that fateful Saturday morning, Jasmyn’s former husband, Tyron Victor Lambert, aged 42, forcibly entered her home on Topaz Street in Dallas, Cobb County. He threatened everyone in the house with a gun and ordered them to leave. When the police arrived at the scene, Lambert had already fled.</span></p><p><span>On that ill-fated Sunday morning, Tyron Lambert, a violent and jealous husband, once again intruded into Jasmyn Lambert’s home after causing chaos and making threats the previous day. This time, he was determined to harm his beautiful and accomplished wife.</span></p><p><span>As the police rushed to the scene, gunshots rang out. Two bullets pierced Jasmyn’s heart before the police could intervene. She passed away on the spot, with tears still in her eyes and a smile as her final farewell to her beloved students.</span></p><p><span>Tyron Lambert, the murderer, was immediately subdued and apprehended by the police. He will face first-degree murder charges and is likely to spend the rest of his life behind bars, a fitting consequence for his heinous actions.</span></p><p><span>The community is utterly shocked by the tragic death of the young teacher. Jasmyn had been a guiding light for generations of students, instilling knowledge and good values with her radiant smile and boundless love. Her students feel like they’ve lost a second mother, and for the community, this is an irreplaceable loss.</span></p><a href=# data-slb-active=1 data-slb-asset=1350000537 data-slb-group=54883><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-54885 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/galaxylands.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jasmyn-Lambert-Obituary-2.webp alt="Teacher Jasmyn Lambert's death was caused by her cold-blooded husband" width=750 height=448 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p id=caption-attachment-54885 class=wp-caption-text><span>Teacher Jasmyn Lambert’s death was caused by her cold-blooded husband</span></p><h3><span>Remembering teacher Jasmyn Lambert</span></h3><p><span>The county spokesperson issued the following statement regarding the passing of Jasmyn Lambert:</span></p><p><span>“We are deeply saddened to share the loss of a beloved third-grade teacher.
