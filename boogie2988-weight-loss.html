However, unfortunately for him, Boogie2988 never reached his goal weight and has been unable to maintain his weight loss, he relapsed and gave in to the eating disorder he said he had, and now, he weighs 391.6 pounds.</strong></p><p><strong>Steven Williams</strong>, who is better known by his online alias <strong>Boogie2988</strong> or simply <strong>Boogie</strong>, came into prominence with his video rants on Youtube about video games and nerd culture as a character named <strong>Francis</strong>. As the <a href=#><strong>Youtuber</strong></a> got more popular in the online community, he started getting personal with his followers and began sharing about his weight loss journey except he never made any effort to lose weight.</p><p>He had gastric bypass surgery in 2017 which made it seem like he was very sincere about getting in shape and being healthy but that was all he did. He did not even change his lifestyle to maintain his body afterward and ended up gaining weight again. Let's discuss Boogie2988's weight loss journey!</p><p>There are more <strong><a href=#>weight loss</a></strong> stories of <a href=#><strong>Salt Papi</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sonia Evans</strong></a> that you might want to read.</p><h2>Boogie2988's Weight Loss Surgery: He Lost 100 Pounds After Undergoing Gastric Bypass Surgery!</h2><p><strong>Boogie2988 </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@realboogie2988</a>), the Youtuber whose real name is <strong>Steven Williams</strong>, underwent a significant weight loss of <strong>100</strong> <strong>pounds</strong> in 2017 after having gastric bypass surgery. He was 500 pounds before he had the surgery and he lost about 50 pounds after starting a diet. In the <a href=# rel=noopener>boxing match</a> he had recently, he seems to have put on weight again.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/boogie2988-pic.jpg alt="Boogie2988 had a weight loss of 100 pounds after he had gastric bypass surgery. " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Boogie2988 underwent a weight loss of 100 pounds after he had gastric bypass surgery.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Insider</strong></p><p>Boogie2988 has always struggled with his weight. He was just another fat kid when he was a child but as he grew up, his weight issues got worse and by the time he was an adult, he was morbidly obese. He weighed 500 pounds. He looked massive and he was aware that he was massive every instant because 500 pounds is a huge burden to carry and it became an inconvenience even while doing the simplest of tasks like walking. He seriously needed to embark on a weight loss journey.</p><p>And Boogie2988 said that he was on a weight loss journey. But because he weighed the same for the longest of time and never lost weight, it was hard to believe he was doing something about his morbid obesity. In 2012, the status quo changed but he did not lose weight, instead, he gained. When fans got concerned, he said that the weight gain was minimal and it just paused the 'weight loss.' It did not look like he was ever serious about losing weight.</p><p>But 2017 came and Boogie2988 underwent gastric bypass surgery. He had already been on a diet and lost 50 pounds before he had the operation. After the operation, he saw a 100 pounds drop and that was the most significant weight loss he had ever had. To reach his goal weight of 300 pounds, he had 50 more pounds to lose, and his fans thought, 'what's 50 more?' because he finally looked determined to keep his weight in check. He did say he was worried about his life cutting short because of morbid obesity and that he was stupidly motivated to not have that happen.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/05/boogie2988-pic2.jpg alt="Boogie2988 could not maintain his weight loss after having the surgery. " width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Boogie2988 could not maintain his weight loss after having the surgery.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Newsweek</strong></p><p>But Boogie2988 never reached his goal weight of 300 pounds and in fact, he could not even retain his weight loss. That's right, he undid everything that the gastric bypass surgery did. He gained again. And he was <a href=# rel=noopener>criticized by his followers</a> for that. Right now, he weighs 391.6 pounds and he is about 100 pounds from his goal weight but it doesn't look like he will ever bridge the gap because every time his weight comes up, he starts making excuses for it.</p><p>Not that anybody's weight should be our concern and we should be criticizing others for gaining weight, but because Boogie2988 has constantly tried to position himself as a weight loss influencer, ever since he had the operation, fans have become too invested in it and now, they are disappointed in him. They didn't like how he didn't change his lifestyle after having the surgery because how could surgery help if he didn't actually make a change himself? It only gives people a headstart and there is the rest of the journey to go on.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>4 years ago I got gastric bypass surgery.</p><p>My biggest was 587.<br>Day of surgery I was 495.<br>Today I weighed 377.</p><p>To many this adds up as a failure. I never hit my goal of 300.</p><p>But I am proud I lost 200 pounds and saved my own life by keeping it off. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/D2AnTTpxLV</a></p><p>— Boogie2988 (@Boogie2988) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 31, 2021</a></p><p>Boogie2988's fans were annoyed that he was making his weight such an important part of his identity and trying to pass off as a weight loss inspiration when he didn't make any effort for it. He sure underwent the gastric bypass surgery and lost about 100 pounds but he never got closer to his goal weight. When it came to working on changing his lifestyle, his diet, he didn't do any of it. He just gained weight and excused himself saying he was addicted to food.</p><p>Now, fans no longer look to Boogie2988 as an inspiration for weight loss and fitness. Because they now think that he is never going to be serious about losing weight. Because whenever the fact that he has relapsed and he has regained weight is brought up, he talks about struggling to lose weight because of an eating disorder and never holds himself accountable, always making excuses for himself. He had many years to deal with his addiction with food but he didn't and it does not look like he is ever going to change his way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiZqKeXnrJzhZdxZLCdmZy1tXnLqKqsZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-rich-is-magnus-carlsen-net-worth-in-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Rich Is Magnus Carlsen?
